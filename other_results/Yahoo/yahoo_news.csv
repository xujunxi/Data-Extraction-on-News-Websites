Warren, who is currently a U.S. Senator in Massachusetts, is regarded as one of the more liberal candidates in the current Democratic race. The senator has built her campaign on promising middle-class Americans to fight for their equality.  “Rich guys have been waging class warfare against hard-working people for decades ,” Warren said in her speech announcing her candidacy for president. “ I say it’s time to fight back!”  READ MORE: Bill de Blasio's net worth as he pulls out of the 2020 presidential race  In February, the senator filed personal financial disclosures for her candidacy which were obtained by The Center for Public Integrity and later revealed on Twitter.  2/ pic.twitter.com/brc938IPZ3 According to the documents, Warren amassed a majority of her wealth from bond and mutual funds -- as well as retirement accounts and book royalties.

President Reuven Rivlin announced his decision late Wednesday after a second meeting aimed at brokering a unity deal between Netanyahu and Gantz ended without an agreement.",https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-pm-rival-meet-final-110738975.html,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's president on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a new government, giving the longtime leader the difficult task of breaking a post-election deadlock that has paralyzed the country's political system. After a divisive campaign, Netanyahu called for a ""broad unity government"" with his chief rival former military chief Benny Gantz. But he faces an uphill struggle, with his future clouded by a likely corruption indictment and his opponents opposed to sitting with him. President Reuven Rivlin announced his decision late Wednesday after a second meeting aimed at brokering a unity deal between Netanyahu and Gantz ended without an agreement. Standing alongside Rivlin, Netanyahu said it was clear that neither his Likud party nor Gantz's Blue and White could put together a coalition on its own, and that the only option was to band together. ""The two of us cannot form a government unless we are together,"" he said. ""The order of the moment is a unity government, a broad national unity government that is formed quickly."" He said the country faced great security challenges, highlighted by Iran, economic challenges and the ""great opportunity"" of settling its borders when President Donald Trump presents an expected Mideast peace plan. In a statement, Gantz appeared to rebuff Netanyahu, citing the Israeli leader's legal problems. ""Blue and White, led by me, does not agree to sit in a government whose leader is facing a severe indictment,"" he said. ""This issue, among a number of other critical factors, is more important to us than any delegation of ministerial posts or rotation."" Rivlin said his decision was not a solution and that both candidates were responsible for resolving the political impasse.  ""The Israeli people need to know that a government can be established,"" he said. ""It is true that everyone will have to compromise. But if a government is not formed, it is the citizens of Israel who will pay the greatest price."" Rivlin said his decision was not a solution, and that both candidates were responsible for resolving the political impasse. Although Rivlin's duties are mostly ceremonial, he is responsible for choosing the candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a coalition government. That is usually a straightforward task. But in last week's election, neither Netanyahu's Likud party nor Gantz's centrist Blue and White secured the required parliamentary majority needed to form a government. According to final official results announced Wednesday, Blue and White finished first with 33 seats in the 120-seat parliament, just ahead of Likud's 32 seats. Even with the support of smaller allies, both parties are short of the required 61-seat majority. A total of 55 lawmakers have recommended that Netanyahu lead the next government, while 54 have lined up behind Gantz. Rivlin said that after exploring all options, he concluded Netanyahu had the better chance of forming a government. Netanyahu now has a preliminary 28-day period to try to broker a deal. But his odds of success appear to be slim. Both sides agree a unity deal is the only way out of the deadlock, but they have disagreed over who should head it. Gantz has repeatedly said he will not sit with Likud as long as Netanyahu is at the helm. Facing a likely corruption indictment in the coming months, Netanyahu is desperate to remain as prime minister. Israel's attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a series of scandals. Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, is to appear at a hearing with the attorney general next week, after which a final decision on charges is expected. Legal experts say the likelihood of an indictment is high. Although Netanyahu would not be required to step down if charged, he will face heavy pressure to do so. Another key player throughout the process will be Avigdor Lieberman, whose Yisrael Beitenu party controls eight seats. Lieberman refused to endorse either candidate and is pushing for a unity government. Without a unity deal, Netanyahu will have a tough time putting together a coalition. The secular Lieberman says he will not be part of a government that includes Netanyahu's ultra-religious allies. Netanyahu now has 28 days to form a coalition, and Rivlin having discretion to give him an additional 14 days to do so. If Netanyahu fails, Gantz would likely be given an opportunity. And if that fails, a majority of parliament members could offer a third name to be prime minister. And if that fails, Israel would be forced into holding its third election in less than a year. Last week's election was triggered after Lieberman refused to join Netanyahu's coalition following April elections, citing what he said was excessive influence of religious parties. Instead of giving Gantz a chance to form a government, Netanyahu dissolved parliament and ordered a new election. Netanyahu said that if he fails this time, he will allow Rivlin to choose another candidate. ""The nation does not want another election,"" Rivlin said."
3,irans-strange-navy-small-fast-114700802.html,"Irans Strange Navy of Small, Fast Boats Is No Joke","Tue, 24 Sep 2019 07:47:00 -0400","A ""mad max"" threat?",https://news.yahoo.com/irans-strange-navy-small-fast-114700802.html,"Key point: Iran's navy could still threaten American forces, perhaps even an aircraft carrier. On May 16, 2019, U.S. officials cited reports that Iran had installed missiles on civilian motorboats in the Persian Gulf as a justification for a major deployment of U.S. military forces to the Middle East. However, this claim may ring a bit strangely to observers of Iran’s military, as employing swarms of heavily armed motor boats to launch asymmetric attacks on maritime assets has long been understood to be its naval strategy—one that Tehran hasn’t exactly been shy about publicizing. Take, for example, this video which depicts a swarm of rocket-armed boats unleashing a hail of rockets upon a giant mockup of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf. Besides the rocket-armed motor boats, note also the presence of anti-ship ballistic missiles (detailed in this article) and other assets that could be cued to hit naval targets. In another ironic incident, a U.S. military diagram explaining Iranian tactics was founded and adopted by Iranian media to advertise its military strength (and was then breathlessly reported in the U.S. as a “new” Iranian threat.) The U.S. Navy even designed its Littoral Combat Ships with countering Iranian fast boats in mind—to its current regret as it re-orient to “great power” conflict. Both civil and military shipping in the Persian Gulf is exceptionally vulnerable to mines, cruise missiles and fast boat attacks because its shallow straits force large ships to squeeze through predictable lines of transit. Iran is unusual for having two navies. The older, Artesh (“regular”) Iranian Navy focuses on operating larger corvettes, frigates and missile boats, as well as over two-dozen submarines. Its area of operations is chiefly further afield in the Straits of Hormuz, the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. Its twenty-two Ghadir-class midget submarines, however, are well suited to ambush warfare in the shallow and rocky waters of the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile, the quasi-military Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps also has its own Navy, counting over 1,500 fast boats designed to rapid swarming attacks in the shallow littoral waters of the Persian Gulf. Effectively answerable to religious hardliners rather than the head-of-state, the IRCGN has been involved in more provocative diplomatic incidents, such as the seizure of a U.S. Navy fast assault boat in January 2016. In terms of ‘civilian boats,’ the IRGCN musters hundreds of fast-in-short boats are on the pattern of the open-cabin ‘Boston Whaler’ motorboat, typically fitted with unguided rocket launchers, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank missiles and recoilless rifles. Other popular platforms include Swedish Boghammar motorboats and rigid-hull Zodiac inflatable rubber dinghies. These small watercraft can be based on isolated islands and oil platforms in the middle of the Persian Gulf. However, Iran also is manufacturing specialized military speed boats with more impressive capabilities. One example is the Seraj-1, reverse-engineered from a British Bladerunner 51 speed boat purchased from South Africa. Photos reveal these have been armed with a multiple-rocket-launcher system and a heavy anti-aircraft machinegun on the prow. The Seraj can reportedly attain speeds of 55 to 72 knots. The sleek, domestically-designed Zolfaghar (video here) has a maximum speed of 70 knots and mounts an integrated radar and two launch canisters for Nasr-1 cruise missiles on its stern. Based on the Chinese C704 missile, the Nasr-1 has a range of 22 miles, and can use infrared, radar or television guidance. Iranian media has also released images revealing the boat’s simple cockpit and computer displays, and an apparent mass-production line for the boats. Even more exotic watercraft includes semi-submersible boats designed to partially submerge below the water to evade detection for sabotage, special-forces insertion and spying. Finally, on the heavy end the IRGCN can deploy twenty Thondar-class fast attack boats armed (Chinese Houdong-class) with four C802 anti-ship missiles each, and ten Tir-II torpedo motorboats. If the Mad Max-style tactics of barreling towards enemies at maximum speed in swarms of over-gunned open-topped motor vehicles seems outlandish, it has a certain logic for Iran. The small and affordable boats have low radar signatures, which combined with speed, would significantly reduce their target’s reaction time. More importantly, their sheer numbers could overwhelm the expensive defensive systems onboard U.S. warships—if necessary, by running them dry of ammunition. A similar swarming missile strategy was creatively employed by Marine General Paul Van Riper, who led an Iran-like Red Team in a U.S. military exercise called the Millennium Challenge 2002. Van Riper launched a preemptive strike against an approaching U.S. amphibious force using a huge anti-ship cruise missile barrage that over-saturated their sophisticated Aegis air defense systems. This was combined with a swarming attack by fast boats. His attack sank sixteen ships and killed 20,000 Blue Team personnel. Van Riper apparently hadn’t understood that he was meant to lose the wargame in order to validate U.S. military doctrine, so the exercise was promptly rebooted to have the ‘right’ outcome. Although one can only extrapolate so much from a lone wargame, Van Riper’s tactics also illustrate that motorboat swarms would only be employed as a component in a larger strategy that would likely involve long-range land-based cruise missiles, ship and drone-based reconnaissance assets to cue those missiles onto target, midget submarine attacks and naval mines. Iran’s vast stock of over three thousand naval mines, for example, could gravely impede access to the Gulf, and could be deployed via small Ashora-class boats, submarines, corvettes, helicopters and so forth. Domestic Iranian drones or Iran’s bizarre ground-effect hovercraft could spy on the position of enemy ships and transmit targeting coordinates to land-based missiles. Iran has imported Chinese C802 Silkworm missiles with a strike range of 120 miles, as well as reverse-engineered its own domestic Noor cruise missile, and begun working on a 200-mile range Ghadir ASCM. And the Persian Gulf ranges in width only between 35 to 212 miles. It’s worth concluding by observing that Iran’s naval strategy is one of a military underdog seeking to deter stronger opponents. Tehran wants its enemies to fear that a Western war with Iran would result in extensive damage to the tankers carrying one-third of the world’s oil across the Straits of Hormuz, and for the U.S. Navy to think twice whenever it deploys aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf. From the IRGCN’s standpoint, the U.S. Navy’s advanced warships bristling with missiles are the Death Star, and its swarms of fast boats the plucky, maneuverable fighters capable overwhelming advanced defenses to deal a lethal blow. Whether fast boat swarms could adequately leverage the narrow littoral waters of the Persian Gulf and prove effective versus modern warships has never truly been combat-tested—and hopefully, never will be.

Rashida Tlaib asked a pro-vaping witness if she is a conspiracy theorist, prompting a tense back-and-forth that ended in the chairman calling for order. Vicki Porter, a 51-year-old Wisconsin resident, was a witness at the ""Don't Vape"" hearing invited by the Republican committee members. After she gave testimony about her experience as a former smoker who was only able to quit nicotine after discovering electronic cigarettes.  ""It literally changed and probably saved my life,"" Porter testified. ""My lungs are healthy... Vaping is a health miracle to me."" Vaping lung illness: What we know about the recent spate of cases and deaths Tlaib spoke about the history of the tobacco industry and the evolution of the public's knowledge about the dangers of smoking.  ""It's so important that you all continue to speak truth about this, because the long-term effects is very dangerous, especially because they have been targeted towards youth,"" Tlaib said. The hearing on Tuesday was called in response to the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warning about several deaths linked to vaping, though no specific cause has been identified for lung illnesses thus far. But things took a turn when Tlaib questioned Porter's motivations for appearing before the committee.  ""You know, Ms. Porter, I was reading because I want to know more about you and your beliefs,"" Tlaib said. ""You call yourself a converted conservative and a reformed Marxist,"" Tlaib continued. ""Are you a conspiracy theorist?"" ""I think my politics are entirely irrelevant to this hearing,"" Porter replied. ""Oh, OK, why were you winking at one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle? You winked."" Tlaib asked. Porter responded, saying that she knows Wisconsin Rep. Glenn Grothman, who was present at the hearing.  ""He's a friend of mine,"" Porter said. ""I didn't know what the winking was,"" Tlaib said. ""I thought maybe there was something, like a conspiracy thing going on there. I didn't know."" ""You think there's a conspiracy in this hearing, ma'am?"" Porter said. The two went back and forth as Tlaib said Porter's idea of ""truth"" was different from many others at the hearing. ""The truth for me is I quit smoking with e-cigarettes and so did 8 million other people,"" Porter said as the two talked over each other."" ""You're still smoking, ma'am, you're still smoking,"" Tlaib fired back, referring to the fact that Porter now uses e-cigarettes. ""I'm not smoking,"" Porter said. As the chairman called for order, Porter added ""And I'm not lying under oath."" More: Trump's proposed ban on vape flavors may not stop teens from vaping, experts warn The committee's hearing comes as President Donald Trump is considering legislation that would ban the use of flavored e-cigarettes over concern that they are targeted toward children. According to a new report in Axios, conservative leaders are warning that Trump's proposed ban may hurt his re-election chances in battleground states with significant populations of adults who use vaping products. The state of Massachusetts has also recently banned sale of all vape products in the state for four months, and the city of San Francisco implemented a ban in June.

The politician, lawyer and entrepreneur, gained national attention in 2018 when she ran against Brian Kemp for governor of Georgia. The race made history as Abrams became the first black woman to be a gubernatorial nominee for a major political party. Though she ultimately lost the election, her charisma and relatability won over the support of many. From the controversial loss, however, sprung Abrams' intensified advocacy for voters' right and the end of voter suppression across the country.  READ MORE: Senator Elizabeth Warren's net worth revealed as the 2020 Presidential Election heats up  Officially, Abrams has yet to concede, but she has recognized Kemp as the legal victor of the race.  “I’m not saying they stole it from me,” Abrams said at a National Action Network convention in New York City. “They stole it from the voters of Georgia.” Despite Abrams' high-profile status, she still makes time to spread words of encouragement to others who may not have thought a viable career in politics or any underrepresented industry is possible. ""My job is to be a voice for others,"" Abrams explained.  Abrams recently attended Bustle's second annual Rule Breakers event in New York where they celebrated the politician for breaking barriers in politics. The day-long festival ""honors women and non-binary individuals who are breaking barriers, shaping today’s culture, and defying expectations and the status quo.""  “You don't have to be born wealthy, you don't have to be born beautiful, you don't have to be born white, you don't have to be born into a family of brilliant people, you just have to be. By being, you're already started,” Abrams said.  The political icon has long been a figure of hope for marginalized communities, but for women of color, especially black women, in particular, Abrams' journey proves anything is possible with hard work, determination and 'breaking all the rules and creating new ones' if necessary.  ""It's not a detriment, it's an asset,"" she proudly exclaimed. ""I hope every single person who comes up to me, especially young women who are afraid to wear their natural hair or who don't think they're ready because they haven't lost the weight -- if you are ready, you are ready. You don't have to wait for the rest of the world because they never will be. They're ready when we show up."" she continued. As far as the next career move for Abrams, she responded, ""what I do next, has to be something I do because it helps me do the work I want to do in the best way possible."" She adds, however, that not running for office doesn't mean she's ""out of the process."""

Newsweek reported that the prisoner's name wouldn't be released until law enforcement in Wisconsin can verify a confession. The director of ""Convicting a Murderer,"" Shawn Rech, told Newsweek that the inmate was a convicted killer. ""We haven't confirmed the legitimacy of the confession, but seeing as it was given by a notable convicted murderer from Wisconsin, we feel responsible to deliver any and all possible evidence to law enforcement and legal teams,"" Rech said.

He is weighing how best to address the issue of violence and calculating which policies would actually work. It’s not a simple task, and it requires careful consideration of two facts that media outlets would rather ignore: Universal background checks and “assault weapons” bans aren’t the solution. Universal background checks would do nothing to stop mass shootings. The simple fact remains that all mass shooters in recent history passed a background check except for three — two of whom stole their firearms and one of whom reports say bought his rifle from an illegal manufacturer. The House will hear testimony regarding a ban on so-called assault weapons. This is equally ineffective. America banned what anti-gun activists call “assault weapons” from 1994 to 2004, and two independent Justice Department studies found that the ban had no impact on crime. Semiautomatic rifles are popular in America today, with more than 16 million in circulation. They are used in less than 2% of firearm homicides. That means every time an “assault weapon” was misused, nearly 16 million weren’t. The media obsession with these firearms erroneously leads the public to believe they’re used in most mass killings. That’s not true. Perpetrators have used fire, knives, vehicles and other firearms to commit heinous acts. OUR VIEW: Donald Trump called for 'strong background checks' after El Paso and Dayton. Now? Crickets The Second Amendment protects firearms in common use. These rifles are used safely every day for hunting, competition and self-defense. But that hasn’t deterred anti-gun states from attempting to ban them. America’s violent crime rate is at historically low levels. We should look to the solutions that led to dramatic reductions in violent crime during the 1990s and that don’t strip Americans of their constitutionally protected right to defend themselves. We must fix our broken mental health system and the revolving-door justice system that fails to hold criminals accountable.

Nicole Hockley's son Dylan was one of 20 children who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut on Dec. 14, 2012. The shooting, which was one of the country's deadliest, sparked a heated debate about gun control and led to the introduction of legislation that would have banned certain types of firearms.  On Monday, Hockley took to social media to remember him in several emotional tweets. ""Today it's been 2,474 days since Dylan was murdered at Sandy Hook,"" she wrote. ""2,474 days since he's been gone from my life. He was only in my life for 2,473 days. I feared today. Would him being gone longer than he was here mean I would forget him?""

""His laugh, his eyes, the smell of his hair, his voice, the feel of his hand in mine?"" she wrote. ""I am sad today, but I no longer have fear. I have forgotten nothing. My son lives on in my heart, in my soul, in the memories of our family and friends and in the work of me and his Daddy."" His laugh, his eyes, the smell of his hair, his voice, the feel of his hand in mine? I am sad today, but I no longer have fear. I have forgotten nothing. My son lives on in my heart, in my soul, in the memories of our family and friends and in the work of me and his Daddy. ""We will always love him and miss him,"" she concluded. ""My butterfly is gone, but never forgotten, no matter how many days go by."" We will always love him and miss him. My butterfly is gone, but never forgotten, no matter how many days go by. Since Monday, Hockley's tweets have been liked more than 30,000 times and shared 5,000 times. In the wake of her son's death, the mother co-founded Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit that teaches students and adults how to recognize signs of gun violence. ""Based in Newtown, Connecticut, our intent is to honor all victims of gun violence by turning our tragedy into a moment of transformation by providing programs and practices that protect children from gun violence,"" the organization's mission statement reads. ""By uniting people of all beliefs and backgrounds who value the protection of children to take meaningful actions in their homes and communities, we will prevent gun violence and stop the tragic loss of life."" Sandy Hook Promise has reportedly trained more than 7.5 million adults and children and has recruited over 6,000 volunteers to raise awareness about gun violence. Hockley, who was honored by People in 2016 for activism, said she just wants ""people to know that gun violence is preventable."" ""I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to save other [lives],"" she said in an interview with the magazine.""I don’t want any other parent to ever be in my shoes and to know their child could have lived."""

And some elements of the Trump team’s impeachment strategy predated the current Ukraine scandal that sparked the Democrats’ action. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday morning, shortly after the White House released a rough transcript of the July 25 call the president had with his Ukrainian counterpart that’s now at the center of the controversy, Trump argued there was a “witch hunt” against him. He accused Democrats and “corrupt” media of falsely portraying the conversation as a “call from hell.” “It turned out to be a nothing call,” Trump said. The summary of the call indicated Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s potential Democratic rival in the 2020 election. Providing the rough transcript and insisting it shows no misconduct is just one facet of the Trump team’s response to the impeachment push. The president and his allies are also trying to turn the tables on Biden. Trump’s response also includes pointing at prior calls for impeachment to argue Democrats have been determined to oust him from office from day one, a defense against a potential impeachment that his campaign had prepared well before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi actually announced plans to open an inquiry on Tuesday. Following the release of the transcript, Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, released a statement describing the Ukraine scandal as “just another hoax from Democrats and the media.” “Because of their pure hatred for President Trump, desperate Democrats and the salivating media already had determined their mission: take out the President. The fact is that the President wants to fight the corruption in Washington, where the Bidens, the Clintons, and other career politicians have abused their power for personal gain for decades. The facts prove the President did nothing wrong,” Parscale said, echoing language of a prior statement he sent out shortly after Pelosi’s announcement. The idea there is a “Biden scandal” centers on a dubious claim that, as vice president in 2016, Biden pushed Ukraine’s government to oust a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board starting in 2014. While Joe Biden did call for the prosecutor’s removal, he was one of many international leaders who did so in response to concerns about corruption. And Bloomberg News has reported that the investigation into Burisma had been closed prior to the vice president calling for the prosecutor’s ouster. In fact, in late 2014, the Obama administration pressed the Ukranians to assist the U.K. in a separate investigation into Burisma’s owner. Despite the lack of evidence, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, began pressing the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens role in the prosecutors firing earlier this year. Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Trump’s 2020 campaign, also suggested the Ukraine controversy is really about Biden in an email sent to Yahoo News on Tuesday morning, hours before Pelosi’s announcement. Murtaugh argued that Democrats are trying to exploit a “Biden scandal” because they have “wanted to overturn the legitimate results of the 2016 election ever since President Trump was elected.” “They’ve always wanted to impeach him, and they’ve just been shopping around for an excuse,” Murtaugh said. These comments from top Trump staffers encapsulate the three major elements of the president’s emerging impeachment playbook: predicting the effort will backfire on Democrats, arguing the opposition has wanted to oust Trump from the moment he was elected and trying to shift the focus on Biden. Concerns about Trump’s interactions with Zelensky mounted in recent weeks following the news that an official filed a whistleblower complaint that included Trump’s call with the Ukrainian leader. The director of national intelligence has not yet forwarded the full complaint to Congress. As details of the call came out, Democrats and other critics said Trump was improperly asking a foreign country to interfere in next year’s presidential election by raising questions about the Biden family. After news of that complaint became public, the Washington Post reported that Trump asked that military assistance to Ukraine be delayed. Commercial arms sales to the country were also held up during the past year and the State Department hasn’t turned over required reports documenting those sales to Congress. In the transcript of the call with Zelensky that was released by the White House, Trump asked the Ukrainian president to work with the U.S. attorney general and Giuliani on a potential Biden probe shortly after discussing U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump noted the United States had been “very good to Ukraine” before bringing up Hunter Biden and the fired prosecutor. “There's a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that,” Trump said, adding, “If you can look into it ... it sounds horrible to me.” Following the release of the transcript, the White House accidentally sent out talking points meant for Republican lawmakers to Democrats. The talking points argued “the transcript clearly shows there was no quid pro quo or anything else inappropriate about the conversation between President Trump and President Zelensky.” In the talking points, the White House also made the case it is “appropriate” for Trump to suggest the possibility Biden “used his official position to derail an investigation in another country” should “be looked into.” Earlier this week, as the controversy over Ukraine intensified, one source close to the president admitted the call with Zelensky could have hurt Trump. However, they predicted the Democrats were unlikely to launch an impeachment effort. Even after Pelosi announced the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, the source was unfazed. “Trump is like Rocky Balboa. He can take the punches better than anyone and counterpunch,” the source said. “He’ll absorb these hits and see Biden further collapse.” Regardless of impeachment proceedings, Trump will continue to press Biden on Ukraine. While there has been no evidence Biden or his son engaged in wrongdoing, some critics have said it was unseemly for Hunter Biden, who had little relevant experience, to have a highly paid role on the board of a Ukrainian company as his father led U.S. diplomatic efforts in that country. The source close to the president argued coverage of the ongoing scandal will present Trump an opportunity to highlight these questions and hurt Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. “They dropped a nuclear bomb on working-class Joe Biden by painting him as corporate-class Joe Biden,” the source said. “That’s a fundamental problem when he’s losing ground to Elizabeth Warren, who has this anticorporate message.” The Biden campaign has aggressively fought back against efforts by Trump and his allies to accuse the former vice president of impropriety. Biden scheduled a press conference in his home state of Delaware on Tuesday afternoon to address the Ukraine scandal. “I knew when I decided to run, this president would attack me and anyone else he thought would be a threat to his winning. … Even though every reputable publication has looked at the charge that has been made against me and found them baseless and untrue and without merit, that’s not about to stop him,” Biden said of Trump. A Biden supporter also dismissed the notion there’s any valid comparison between the business dealings of the former vice president’s family and questions about Trump’s Russian ties. “A 787 Dreamliner and a pineapple are also the same thing,” the Biden supporter quipped. While the Ukraine scandal was the impetus for Democratic leadership to open a formal impeachment inquiry, some members of the opposition party were pushing for Trump to be impeached well before this latest issue emerged. Many Democrats have argued the evidence collected by former special counsel Robert Mueller showed impeachable offenses, including potential obstruction of justice by Trump. The Trump campaign, for its part, is arguing that impeachment was always the Democrats’ game plane. After Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director, pointed to a video the president posted on his Twitter page, one of several rapid responses to impeachment from Trump’s team, showing earlier calls for impeachment and describing it as the Democrats’ “sole focus.” “We’ve had that [clip] ready for weeks in case the Dems were that stupid. And they were,” Murtaugh said. The Trump campaign also sent out a fundraising pitch to supporters within an hour of Pelosi’s remarks. The message asked supporters to give $45 to join. “Get on the list of Patriots … ALL DONATIONS DOUBLE-MATCHED,” the message said. _____ Download the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.

Last Saturday, the staff at Eastern High School in Louisville reportedly used rulers to measure each girl's hem to see how high it was above the knees. The school had earlier sent a letter listing the dress code rules, one of which required that dresses be no more than two inches above the top of the knee.  Upon determining that the girls' dresses did not meet that requirement last weekend, school officials allegedly refused to admit them to the dance. Following the incident, one of the girls, an unidentified 15-year-old, admitted to the newspaper that ""it just made me feel awful about myself like I wasn't acceptable."" Her mother Carrie Vittitoe agreed, calling the school's policy a ""sexism issue."" That same day, another parent took to Twitter to voice her anger.  ""Wondering why Eastern High School insulted young girls by MEASURING THEIR DRESSES WITH A RULER AS THEY ENTERED HOMECOMING DANCE??"" wrote Emily Burrice.

""Eastern High School reeks of misogyny and sexism,"" one person wrote.  ""Seriously?!?"" another replied. ""I was in charge of homecoming for 8 years at the school where I work and NOT ONCE did we send a student away for what they were wearing. That’s crazy!"" Eastern has also since been accused by other parents for inconsistently enforcing the dress code.  ""I have two daughters who attend Eastern,"" Lori Chitwood said in an email to the Courier Journal. ""One was admitted, and one was not. It actually ruined my oldest daughter's homecoming.""  In response to the backlash, a spokeswoman for Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS), which oversees Eastern High School, said on Monday that it would review its policies.  ""Student representatives and parent representatives will review the dress code as well, along with a teacher group, and administrators will work with their (school-based decision-making council) to consider suggestions for improvement,"" Renee Murphy said.  In a letter obtained by the newspaper, Eastern High School Principal Lana Kaelin also addressed last week's episode with both students and parents.

""Christ Mocked,"" a work by the 13th century pre-Renaissance painter, was part of a larger display and could be valued between $4.4 to 6.6 million, art expert Éric Turquin told French newspaper Le Figaro. The painting was found in the town of Compiègne after an auctioneer saw the work, which the woman had hung directly above a hotplate, and told her to have it appraised, said Stephane Pinta, a painting specialist with the Turquin gallery in Paris. The woman had thought the work was just an old religious work, the French news agency AFP reported. The painting, about 8 inches by 11 inches, was part of a diptych that was broken up and included eight scenes from the Passsion of the Christ, Le Figaro reported. Two other sections, painted around 1280, are displayed at the Frick Collection in New York and the National Gallery in London. 'Indiana Jones of art': $28 million Picasso, stolen 20 years ago, recovered Turquin told the AFP that art historians used infrared light to analyze the work and determined that there was ""no disputing that the painting was done by the same hand"" as Cimabue's other work. The painting is slated to be auctioned Oct. 27 at the Acteon auction house in Senlis, France. According to Le Figaro, none of Cimabue's paintings have ever been auctioned.  The Florentine painter, also known as Cenni di Pepo, was hugely influential just before the Italian Renaissance began, and art journal The Art Newspaper described him as ""the father of Western painting.""

In announcing a grand jury's findings, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said Officer Salvador Sanchez believed he had been shot in the head and a shooter was on the loose when he and his son were knocked to the ground in the unprovoked assault. Hestrin said his office would not bring its own charges against Sanchez in the wake of the grand jury decision. Sanchez, a seven-year veteran of the LAPD, opened fire June 14, killing 32-year-old Kenneth French and critically injuring his parents, Russell and Paola French. ""In a case like this, it's appropriate for the community to weigh in,"" Hestrin said at a news conference about the grand jury deliberations. ""This case has weighed heavily on us."" Dale Galipo, an attorney for the French family, said he was ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the development. He said he believes prosecutors only took the case to a grand jury to appease the community and may not have pushed hard enough to persuade the jurors. Ira Salzman, Sanchez's lawyer, said his client was ""gratified"" to hear he won't be charged. Salzman said Sanchez did not testify before the grand jury but had given evidence to the district attorney's office regarding his state of mind and subsequent medical records showing a concussion. ""Sal believed he was shot,"" Salzman said. ""The case was a terrible tragedy."" The officer remains on paid administrative leave as the LAPD conducts an inquiry into whether Sanchez followed department policies. The encounter in the Corona warehouse store spanned just 3.8 seconds. Investigators relied on a single, poor-quality surveillance video and witness testimony — some of which had to be compelled through subpoenas. Sanchez, holding his 1½-year-old son, was standing in line for food samples with his wife when French, without warning or provocation, knocked Sanchez and the child to the ground. Seconds later, prosecutors said, Sanchez fired 10 rounds from his handgun, believing his life and his son's life were in immediate danger from an active shooter. Four bullets struck French in the back and shoulder, one struck his mother in the stomach and another hit his father in the back, Corona police Chief George Johnstone said. The gunfire prompted chaos inside the warehouse as terrified shoppers rushed to leave while police officers — who also believed there was an active shooter — ran inside. Witnesses reported seeing Sanchez reach to the back of his head multiple times to look for blood, Hestrin said, noting that Sanchez's claim of being knocked unconscious was not supported by any evidence. Galipo has said Russell and Paola French were trying to explain to the officer that his son had a mental disability when shots rang out. French, of Riverside, had been taken off his medication because of other health complications, which may have affected his behavior that night, Galipo has said. The family has filed a claim — a precursor to a lawsuit — against Sanchez and the Los Angeles Police Department. Galipo said he plans to file a federal lawsuit within the next month. ___ Associated Press Writer John Antczak contributed to this story."

United Auto Workers (UAW) Vice President Terry Dittes told union members in a statement issued late in the day that ""all unsettled proposals are now at the Main Table and have been presented to General Motors.  UAW members went on strike at GM on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker's profit and protection of their healthcare benefits.",https://news.yahoo.com/gm-uaw-union-making-progress-143031307.html,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co and the union that represents its 48,000 striking hourly workers in the United States have made progress in talks toward a new labor deal but are grappling with issues over the pay and job security of newer and temporary workers, two people familiar with the talks said on Wednesday. United Auto Workers (UAW) Vice President Terry Dittes told union members in a statement issued late in the day that ""all unsettled proposals are now at the Main Table and have been presented to General Motors. ""We are awaiting their response,"" Dittes said, adding: ""This back and forth will continue until negotiations are complete."" There are still significant issues that need to be addressed, a person briefed on the matter said. More meetings were set for the evening, but the source said no deal was expected Wednesday. UAW members went on strike at GM on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker's profit and protection of their healthcare benefits. The strike has cost GM about $100 million a day, analysts said. IHS analyst Joe Langley said at a conference on Wednesday the company could lose about 70,000 vehicles of production from a two-week strike and be challenged to make up the loss over the short term. The walkout - the longest autoworker strike in nearly 30 years - has become a political event, attracting the attention of Democratic politicians, who have been visiting the striking workers and voicing their support. The Democratic presidential candidates have echoed the striking workers in saying GM employees deserve fair treatment from the Detroit automaker they helped through bankruptcy. President Donald Trump, a Republican, convinced numerous UAW members to vote for him in 2016, helping him win Michigan, Ohio and other states. He has repeatedly demanded GM find a new vehicle for its now-shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, a key state for him in the 2020 presidential election. GM officials have tried to counter charges that they are abandoning U.S. workers, releasing details of an offer to the UAW that included the promise of investing $7 billion in U.S. plants, annual raises in a new four-year deal, increased profit sharing and retention of existing healthcare insurance. However, the sources familiar with the negotiations said some of the bigger remaining issues relate to how fast newer hires progress to the top UAW pay scale of about $31 an hour. Currently, it takes eight years to reach that level for newer hires and the union wants a faster ramp to the top. Another big issue is the use of temporary workers, who have no pathway to full-time job status and few rights related to sick time or vacation days, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the talks are ongoing. GM has said it can reduce its cost disadvantage with the international automakers in the U.S. market and safeguard union jobs by using temporary workers. The use of temps also allows Detroit automakers to cover for high rates of absenteeism among UAW workers.

The other twin was perfectly healthy, leading doctors to believe the woman was initially pregnant with triplets when one baby absorbed extra limbs from the third unborn fetus. The first-time mother hadn't had any medical checkups throughout her pregnancy and had no idea she was at one point expecting triplets, let alone that she would be giving birth to twins.  She and her husband are described by Metro as laborers, which may explain why they did not have the time or money to visit doctors before giving birth. The couple said they were scared for their daughter, but despite a minor breathing issue — caused by the extra limbs growing out of her abdomen — she is in stable condition.  The baby will be transferred to another hospital in India to undergo an operation, and doctors say they feel confident that the extra limbs can be safely removed during surgery. This case is believed to be the first instance of two naturally born triplets being conjoined.  Earlier this year, 2-year-old Pakistani twins who were conjoined at the head were successfully separated. In August, 3-year-old conjoined twins in Budapest were also safely separated during a 30-hour surgery.  Watch the In The Know video above to learn more."

22,china-launched-special-type-warship-191000486.html,China Launched a Special Type of Warship That Can Help Invade Taiwan,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:10:00 -0400",Beijing now has an 'assault ship'. It probably can accommodate dozens of helicopters and landing craft and hundreds of marines.,https://news.yahoo.com/china-launched-special-type-warship-191000486.html,"You May Also Like: 5 Best Submarines of All Time, 5 Best Aircraft Carriers of All Time, 5 Best Battleships of All Time and Worst Submarine of All Time. The Chinese navy on Sept. 25, 2019 launched its first big-deck amphibious assault ship, or LHD. The Type 075 amphib, which is similar in shape to the U.S. Navy’s own Wasp-class assault ship, could help Chinese forces invade Taiwan, seize disputed islands and project power and presence over a long distance. The assault ship appears to be around 800 feet long and displace around 40,000 tons. It probably can accommodate dozens of helicopters and landing craft and hundreds of marines. The first photos of the vessel’s initial construction appeared in the spring of 2019. It seems the Type 075 went from keel to launch in around six months. When the first Type 075 enters service following potentially months of trials, it will be the Chinese navy’s biggest amphibious ship and an aviation platform second only to Beijing’s growing fleet of aircraft carriers. The Hudong–Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai built the first Type 075 incredibly quickly, Joseph Trevithick noted at The War Zone. “Regardless of how much the ship actually displaces and what its exact capabilities are, what may be most impressive about it is China's ability to proceed so fast with its construction,” Trevithick wrote.  Chinese shipyards have already demonstrated their ability to produce large surface warships with relative rapidity, but work on the Type 075 has progressed at a particularly fast pace. For comparison, it took three years between keel-laying and launch to build the U.S. Navy's second in class USS Tripoli. Also, keep in mind that the U.S. has been building flattop amphibious assault ships for the better part of a century. This is China's first. It is possible that the goal was to have this ship launched ahead celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist State on Oct. 1, 2019, and that CSSC did everything possible to ensure it could meet this timeline. How fast Hudong-Zhonghua is able to get the second hull in the water may offer some insight into how sustainable this pace of work actually is. The first tranche of Type 075s will reportedly consist of three ships in total.

The first tranche of Type 075s will reportedly consist of three ships in total. LHDs, which combine the functions of helicopter carriers and transport docks, can deploy landing craft, hovercraft, helicopters and vertical-launching fighters while also transporting hundreds of soldiers or marines. The U.S. Navy possesses nine Wasp- and America-class LHDs and is building several more. In U.S. service, LHDs not only form the core of amphibious groups, they also can embark large numbers of AV-8B or F-35B jump jets in order to double as light aircraft carriers. China lacks a jump jet, so the country, for now, doesn’t have the option of deploying LHDs as carriers. But LHDs in Chinese service could help the PLAN assert Beijing’s claims to disputed China Seas territories as well as join smaller Type 071 assault ships in any Chinese assault on Taiwan. “China’s investments in its amphibious ship force signal its intent to develop expeditionary warfare capabilities,” according to the 2019 edition of the U.S. Defense Department’s annual report on Chinese military developments.  The PLAN has five large [Type 071] Yuzhao-class ... amphibious transport docks, with three more under construction or outfitting during 2018. The Yuzhao LPD provides a greater and more flexible capability for long-range operations than the PLAN’s older landing ships. It can carry several of the new Yuyi-class air-cushion medium landing craft and four or more helicopters, as well as armored vehicles and PLAN marines for long-distance deployments. The PLAN probably will continue constructing Yuzhao LPDs even as it pursues a follow-on amphibious assault ship that is not only larger but also incorporates a full flight deck for helicopters.

LHDs will be boon to Chinese power-projection. But even with a larger amphibious fleet including big-deck assault ships, Beijing could struggle to defeat Taiwan in a conventional invasion scenario, according to the Pentagon report. “Large-scale amphibious invasion is one of the most complicated and difficult military operations. Success depends upon air- and maritime-superiority, the rapid buildup and sustainment of supplies onshore and uninterrupted support.”“These stresses, combined with China’s combat force attrition and the complexity of urban warfare and counterinsurgency, even assuming a successful landing and breakout, make an amphibious invasion of Taiwan a significant political and military risk.”    Also From TNI: Iran’s Military Could Hurt the U.S. in a War David Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.

And is it legal?",https://news.yahoo.com/scientists-answer-whether-popular-cbd-132800629.html,"Popular culture has crowned CBD oil the new miracle cure for all sorts of ailments — including anxiety, insomnia and chronic pain — but the additive has also been found in consumables ranging from lattes to face creams, begging the question: What is CBD oil? And is it legal? In the Know investigates the new CBD trend, and what scientists think of it, in the video above.  CBD, which is different from THC, is a chemical compound found in cannabis plants. While there have been extensive studies conducted on how THC interacts with the human body, research into what happens when someone ingests CBD is inconclusive — which makes its legal status a gray area in most states. What scientists can confidently conclude is that CBD attaches to receptors in the body that influence anxiety and pain, and most people do report feeling better after taking CBD. But, again, the hard medical evidence supporting what CBD can do is not concrete. The lack of science behind CBD makes deeming it a legal substance a little tricky. Three states — Idaho, South Dakota and Nebraska — have challenged legalizing CBD, even for medical purposes, because of how little information there is.

According to a release shared to social media by the Charleston Police Department, the boy pulled up next to an officer around 12:30 a.m. Tuesday in downtown Charleston.  The boy was alone in the vehicle and he told the officer that he'd driven by himself from Simpsonville, South Carolina, and became lost when the tablet he was using lost GPS signal, according to the release. The boy told the officer his name and that he took his brother's car and drove to Charleston to live with an unknown male he met on Snapchat, the release said.  The officer was able to connect with the boy's father, who was in the process of reporting the boy missing to Simpsonville police, according to the release.  Simpsonville police released a statement about the incident Tuesday afternoon. According to the statement, police responded to a home in Simpsonville around 1:20 a.m. in reference to a missing child and a missing vehicle.  When police arrived, they learned that the missing child had found a key to the family's vehicle and left in an unknown direction, according to the release.  Simpsonville police are actively investigating the incident.  The boy is now back with his family. The tablet was collected for analysis as evidence, according to Charleston police.  More on the app: Snapchat launches new tools for developers, making AR filter creation easier for beginners Due to the child's age, his name will not be released, Simpsonville police said.  The Charleston Police Department also shared a link to a list of internet safety tips for parents and children: Snapchat, like other social media sites, has a minimum user age of 13. According to information provided by Snapchat, children under 13 are redirected to an app called SnapKidz. Underage users sometimes skirt the minimum age by providing an inaccurate birth date at sign on. This gives them open access to share messages, photos and videos with adult users whom they might not know. SnapKidz does not allow users to add friends or send messages. Instead, their photos are saved to their phone's camera roll.  To read a full list of internet safety tips, visit scsafetynet.com.

Judge Kevin K. Allen scolded Alex Whipple for the ""incomprehensible"" terror he inflicted on Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Shelley, her family and the community. Lizzy's disappearance in May triggered a massive search and widespread concern in the picturesque mountain valley community of Logan. ""You will never see the light of day. You will never breathe fresh air again,"" Allen said. ""What you did was so abhorrent and vile that you must spend the rest of your life in prison."" The 22-year-old Whipple declined to speak, hung his head and showed no emotion during the hearing. He pleaded guilty last month to murder, kidnapping and sexual assault as part of an agreement that dismissed charges of obstruction of justice and desecration of a body. Whipple's attorney, Shannon Demler, said his client knew he committed a horrible act and was ready accept his punishment. He said Whipple was raised in an ""imperfect"" family, was physically abused as a child and developed mental health and substance abuse issues while homeless. Demler asked the judge for a sentence that would give Whipple the chance to get out someday if he was rehabilitated. He said Whipple has seemed like a polite, likable young man in their interactions since the crime. ""Deep inside he has some good,"" Demler said. ""I know people in this room may not believe that."" Prosecutors and relatives painted a different picture as a parade of family members came to the podium urging Allen to keep Whipple in prison for life. ""How could someone do this to their own niece?"" said Dejay Smith, Lizzy's uncle. ""I would hope to never see a monster like him walk through this community again."" Then Smith turned around and spoke directly to Whipple. ""There are few things that are more vile than your actions,"" Smith said. ""You are the worst kind of person humanity has to offer."" Another uncle, Zachary Black, also spoke directly to Whipple, who sat only a few feet away. ""You are filth,"" he said. ""I hope you spend the rest of your life in a tiny box."" Police say Whipple killed Lizzy on May 25, after his sister let him spend the night at the family home. Authorities have said they found the girl's blood on Whipple's clothing, and a bloody, broken knife from the family's kitchen near where the body was hidden. She was missing for five days before Whipple told police where to found the child's body — in the woods less than block from her house — after prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. Relatives remembered Lizzy as a sweet, happy little girl who loved drawing, being outdoors and rainbow-colored butterflies. A poster board with pictures of Lizzy and rainbow-colored butterflies was placed on an easel in the front of the courtroom. A victim advocate who worked with the family brought a pair of rainbow-colored tennis shoes Lizzy was excited to wear to kindergarten. Cache County Attorney James Swink called Whipple's crime a ""vicious"" and ""violent"" act that made the community feel ""a little less safe, a little more vulnerable."" Lizzy's mother, Jessica Black, didn't come to court because she said she couldn't bear being in the same room as her brother, but she spoke to reporters afterward and released butterflies to remember her daughter. She called it a difficult day and said it's been ""dark months"" since her daughter was killed but thanked the community for their support. ""I would give anything to be reunited with her, to hug her and hold her one more time,"" she said, crying. ""Our lives will never be the same. We will never forget our sweet girl and the happiness and sunshine she brought us."""

His office insisted he believed the move was lawful.“The Government acted in good faith and in the belief that its approach was both lawful and constitutional,” the Attorney General’s Office said in a statement. “These are complex matters on which senior and distinguished lawyers have disagreed.”The government was “disappointed” by the Supreme Court ruling but will “respect” its decision, it said.Conservative Calls for Rees-Mogg to Resign (6:25 p.m.)George Young, the former Conservative chief whip in the House of Lords, said Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg “needs to go’’ for the government to regain trust of Parliament because it would be “less than credible” if no one resigned.Young, who entered Parliament in 1974, told the BBC that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who provided the government’s legal advice, should also “consider his position.” Young resigned his position in Johnson’s government over the decision to suspend Parliament.Earlier Tuesday, Sky News reported Cox’s advice to the government that suspending Parliament was lawful, citing a leaked document. Rees-Mogg, alongside Chief Whip Mark Spencer, traveled to Scotland this month to advise the Queen she should dissolve Parliament.Varadkar Says ‘Good’ Meeting With Johnson (6:20 p.m.)Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said his meeting with Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York was “good.”“No agreements by any means, but we got into some more details,” he told Bloomberg.Labour to Refuse to Back Conference Recess (6:15 p.m.)The opposition Labour Party will refuse to back a recess next week for the Conservative Party’s annual conference unless the premier requests a delay to Brexit from Brussels.Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn held talks on Tuesday with opposition leaders to discuss the next steps, his office said, adding that Labour doesn’t plan to trigger a no-confidence vote in Boris Johnson’s government in the next two days. Labour also said that for now, the priority is to ensure steps are taken to lock in a delay to Brexit. It would then seek to secure an early general election.Labour said it will use whatever mechanisms available to hold Johnson to account, and reiterated Corbyn’s call for the prime minster to resign.Johnson ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ About Brexit Deal (6 p.m.)Before their meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar expressed their desire for a Brexit deal.“We remain cautiously optimistic, but still cautious,” Johnson said.Varadkar told reporters the Irish government is “very keen that there be a deal, that the U.K. should be able to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion.” But he warned there were “certain guarantees” Ireland expects the U.K. government to honor. That comment likely refers to commitments by then Prime Minister Theresa May that Brexit would not lead to a hard border on the island of Ireland or damage the peace process in Northern Ireland.“It certainly will,” Johnson interjected.BCC Warns of ‘Chilling Effect’ of Labour Policies (5:55 p.m.)Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said Corbyn’s “recipe for deep intervention and unprecedented overreach into the way that businesses are run would have a chilling effect on both confidence and investment.”He warned that if Labour “pushes too far” they could undermine employment and investment at a time when the uncertainty of Brexit is already hitting companies.“At a moment of critical national importance, Jeremy Corbyn should be extending the hand of friendship to businesses - not insisting that its us versus them,” he said.Trump Praises Johnson’s ‘Progress’ (5:45 p.m.)President Donald Trump said the U.S. and U.K. can “quadruple” trade after Brexit at the start of a meeting with Boris Johnson in New York.“It’s not easy and he’s doing a really good job. He’s going to make really great progress,’’ Trump said. “The results are going to start to show in November. But it looks to be like he’s making good progress.’’“We’re going to be discussing trade,’’ Trump said. “We can quadruple out trade with the U.K. and I think we can really do a big job.”U.K. Sends Fourth Proposals Text to Brussels (5:25 p.m.)The U.K has sent a fourth set of informal proposals to the European Commission, laying out alternative arrangements to the infamous backstop, two EU diplomats said on condition of anonymity.The document will be discussed between EU and British negotiators on Wednesday, and the Commission will then debrief member states on any progress achieved.Last week, three similar “non-papers” sent by the U.K were summarily rejected. The Commission said they were neither legally operational solutions for keeping the Irish border open, nor did they meet the objectives of the backstop.Labour Plans State-Owned Drugs Maker (5:15 p.m.)Corbyn pledged to start a state-owned drugs manufacturer if elected, to drive down costs for the National Health Service.He said private drugs companies will have to make their products more affordable in order to access public research funding. “We will create a new publicly owned generic drugs manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to our NHS saving our health service money and saving lives,” Corbyn said.Corbyn Greeted by Standing Ovations (5.10 p.m.)Delegates in the hall, who have been cheering every time Corbyn’s name was mentioned in the run-up to the speech, were pumped up by the time he appeared.To chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” and “Johnson out,” the packed conference hall gave him multiple standing ovations. They particularly approved of his plans to re-nationalize utilities and bring down medicine prices.Johnson to Push on With Brexit (4:50 p.m.)At his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, reporters asked Johnson whether he plans to resign for misleading the Queen, the prime minister replied: “Let’s be absolutely clear. We respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court.”“We need to get on with Brexit,” Johnson said, adding that he disagrees “profoundly” with the Supreme Court’s judgment. He said the government has a “dynamic domestic agenda” to get on with and intends to do so.Separately, Johnson also reiterated that the state-run National Health Service is “not for sale” in any free-trade deal with the U.S.Labour wants election, but Not Yet, Corbyn Says (4:45 p.m.)labour leader Jeremy Corbyn held his line that an election should only take place once the risk of a no-deal Brexit has gone.“This crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government’s threat of a disastrous No Deal is taken off the table,” Corbyn said in a speech to Labour’s annual conference.“After what has taken place no one can trust this government and this Prime Minister not to use this crisis of their own making and drive our country over a No Deal cliff edge in five weeks’ time,” Corbyn said.Johnson Says U.K. Needs General Election (2:30 p.m.)Johnson told reporters in New York the U.K. needs a general election. He criticized opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has resisted demands for a snap poll -- because he doesn’t trust Johnson not to use it to force through a no-deal Brexit.“Jeremy Corbyn is talking out of the back of his head and we must have an election,” Johnson said. The prime minister will hold a conference call with Cabinet ministers at 6 p.m. before his speech to the United Nations. He will then fly back to the U.K.Delivering a speech earlier to business leaders, Johnson reiterated that he disagrees with the Supreme Court’s judgment.“We in the U.K. will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the EU on Oct. 31,” he said. “Because that it was we were mandated to do.”Johnson’s Office Says He Won’t Resign (1:30 p.m.)Johnson’s office, briefing reporters in New York City, insisted the prime minister will not resign, despite calls from opposition parties (see 11:10 a.m.).Johnson will return to the U.K. after delivering his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, scheduled for 8 p.m. local time, they said.Johnson Pledges to ‘Get On’ With Brexit (1:15 p.m.)Speaking in New York City, where he is due to address the United Nations General Assembly, Johnson stood by his commitment to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31, blaming the claimants who brought the case to the Supreme Court for seeking to “frustrate” Brexit.“Obviously this is a verdict that we will respect and we respect the judicial process,” Johnson said in a pooled TV interview. “I have to say that I strongly disagree with what the justices have found. I don’t think that it’s right but we will go ahead and of course Parliament will come back.”“The most important thing is we get on and deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 and clearly the claimants in this case are determined to frustrate that and to stop that,” Johnson said. “I think it would be very unfortunate if Parliament made that objective which the people want more difficult, but we will get on.”Corbyn to Give Speech This Afternoon (12:45 p.m.)Jeremy Corbyn’s office confirmed to journalists in Brighton that the opposition leader will make his conference speech at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, a day earlier than scheduled. Deputy Leader Tom Watson -- who had been due to speak on Tuesday afternoon -- would now speak place on Wednesday, they said.But Watson -- who was subject to an attempt by Corbyn supporters to abolish his position at the start of the party’s conference -- tweeted that he wouldn’t make the speech.“I will be with all Labour colleagues in Parliament tomorrow,” Watson wrote. “I’ll have to save the speech until the next conference.”Parliament to Resume Wednesday: Bercow (12:20 p.m.)Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said the House of Commons will meet at 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday. He emphasized it would not be a recall, but a “resumption” because the Supreme Court ruled suspension unlawful.There will be no Prime Minister’s Questions, a usual fixture on the agenda on Wednesdays, but Bercow said “for the avoidance of doubt, there will be full scope for urgent questions, ministerial statements and applications for emergency debates.”Emergency debates are what Members of Parliament used to seize control of the agenda earlier this month to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.Corbyn Moves Speech Forward to Tuesday (12:15 p.m.)After Parliament was recalled to sit on Wednesday, Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his speech to the party’s annual conference on Tuesday, his office said in Brighton. Corbyn had been due to speak on Wednesday. No time was given for the rescheduled speech.‘Perfectly Obvious’ Johnson Was Lying: Grieve (11:50 a.m.)Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who was kicked out of the parliamentary Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Brexit, said it was “perfectly obvious” that the prime minister’s stated reason for suspending Parliament was “bogus and untrue.”“I’m not surprised by the judgment because of the gross misbehavior by the prime minister,” Grieve told the BBC. “He should be pausing and reflecting on the untold damage he is doing to our institutions.”Farage Turns Fire on Johnson’s Key Adviser (11:40 a.m.)Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, after the Supreme Court ruled the suspension of Parliament for five weeks was unlawful.“The calling of a Queen’s Speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go,” Farage said on Twitter.Cummings has been a lightning rod for criticism of Johnson and has been criticized by opposition lawmakers, as well as some from the prime minister’s Conservative Party, for overseeing an uncompromising hard-Brexit operation in Johnson’s office.Rudd: PM Withheld Legal Advice from Cabinet (11:35 a.m.)Amber Rudd, who quit Boris Johnson’s government this month after accusing him of not working toward a deal with the European Union, said the prime minister had not shown the legal advice on suspending Parliament to the rest of the Cabinet.“This is an astonishing moment and I regret that the PM, who entered office with such goodwill, went down this route,” Rudd said on Twitter, urging Johnson to “work with Parliament” to pass a Brexit deal.EU Not Commenting on U.K. Court Ruling (11:15 a.m.)The European Commission won’t comment on the U.K.’s “internal constitutional matters,” its spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud told reporters in Brussels. “Our interlocutor remains the government of the U.K.,” she said.Calls Mounting for Johnson to Resign (11:10 a.m.)Other party leaders backed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s call for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign.“Boris Johnson isn’t fit to be prime minister,” Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said on Twitter. “He’s misled Queen and country, and unlawfully silenced the people’s representatives. I’m on my way to resume my duties in the Commons and stop Brexit altogether.”Liz Saville Roberts, leader of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, said: “There is no question, the prime minister must resign immediately and a crash out Brexit stopped once and for all.” The Scottish Nationalist Party’s Joanna Cherry said if Johnson “had a shred of integrity, he would jump before he is pushed.”Corbyn Says Johnson Should Quit (11:05 a.m.)Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded Parliament be recalled and called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign after announcing the Supreme Court’s verdict to a standing ovation from delegates at his party’s annual conference in Brighton.“It demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him,” Corbyn said. He said he’d be in touch immediately with House of Commons Speaker John Bercow “to demand that Parliament is recalled so that we can question that prime minister and demand that he obeys the law that’s been passed by Parliament.”Corbyn then invited Johnson “to consider his position” to a further standing ovation and chants of “Johnson Out!” from the delegates.Bercow: Parliament Must Reconvene Without Delay (11 a.m.)Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow called for Parliament to reconvene.“As the embodiment of our Parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay,” Bercow said in a statement. “ To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency.”Court Says Parliament Suspension ‘Unlawful’ (10:45 a.m.)The U.K.’s top judges dealt an unprecedented legal rebuke to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, branding his controversial decision to suspend Parliament unlawful. Parliament must decide what happens next and should meet as soon as possible, judge Brenda Hale said in unanimous ruling.The landmark decision Tuesday is a boost for MPs seeking to prevent Johnson pulling the country out of the European Union by Oct. 31 without a deal. By limiting the prime minister’s power to suspend Parliament in the future, the judges also deprived Johnson of one of his last weapons to force through Brexit before his self-imposed deadline.The decision to prorogue parliament was “unlawful, void and no effect” Judge Brenda Hale, president of the Supreme Court, said in the decision.“The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification,” she said.No Evidence of Criminality by Brexit Campaign Group (10 a.m.)The U.K.’s National Crime Agency said it found no evidence of criminality after investigating possible offenses around foreign involvement in funding for the 2016 EU referendum campaign.Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and the businessman Arron Banks will face no further action, the agency said. Even so, election watchdog the Electoral Commission said in a statement: “We are concerned about the apparent weakness in the law, highlighted by this investigation outcome, which allows overseas funds into U.K. politics.”Labour’s Long-Bailey Keeps ‘Leave’ Option Open (9:30 a.m.)Labour’s Business spokeswoman Rebecca Long-Bailey suggested the party could campaign for ‘Leave’ in a second referendum if it secures the right deal with the European Union after winning a general election. In a Bloomberg TV interview, she denied the party has a “wait-and-see” approach, saying Labour wants a “credible” Brexit deal.“The decision that was made yesterday at conference, that was about assessing that final deal and determining as a party how we would campaign in such a people’s vote,” Long-Bailey said. The assessment of the deal is needed because “it could be 70% of what we’ve asked for; it could be 50% of what we’ve asked for, it could be 100%.”In a speech to the party’s conference Tuesday, Long-Bailey will announce a ramp up in spending on electric vehicles and offshore wind if Labour comes to power. Labour will spend 3.6 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) to expand the electric vehicle charging network, as well as offering 2.5 million people interest free loans to help buy electric cars. She’ll also announce plans to build 37 offshore wind farms, with the government holding a 51% stake, according to Labour.Leadsom: We’ll Obey Law But Seek to Leave on Time (Earlier)Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom insisted the government will abide by the law blocking a no-deal Brexit, but will still seek to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 even if Boris Johnson can’t reach a new Brexit deal.“There’s a huge amount of work to negotiate a deal,” Leadsom said in an interview with BBC Radio. “Should we not get a deal, then we will be seeking to leave the European Union without a deal on the Oct. 31, but we will of course, always, abide by the law. The government always abides by the law.”She didn’t say how it would be possible to both abide by the law -- which says the prime minister must seek an extension from the EU by Oct. 19 if he can’t reach a deal -- while also leaving without a deal on Oct. 31.“We had a referendum over three years ago now, we’ve got to get on and deliver on it and Boris Johnson is the only person who is going to do that,” she said.Earlier:As Johnson Fights for Brexit Deal, Leaders Ask If He’s for RealBoris Johnson Urges EU to Recognize He Has Compromised on BrexitCorbyn Wins Labour Backing for His Wait-and-See Brexit Approach\--With assistance from Jonathan Browning, Jeremy Hodges, Franz Wild, Jessica Shankleman, Tim Ross, Josh Wingrove and Nikos Chrysoloras.To contact the reporters on this story: Robert Hutton in New York at rhutton1@bloomberg.net;Kitty Donaldson in Brighton at kdonaldson1@bloomberg.net;Alex Morales in Brighton, England at amorales2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Thomas PennyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",https://news.yahoo.com/johnson-presses-deal-court-ruling-085301567.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit, sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, and tell us your Brexit story.

We respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court.” “We need to get on with Brexit,” Johnson said, adding that he disagrees “profoundly” with the Supreme Court’s judgment. He said the government has a “dynamic domestic agenda” to get on with and intends to do so. Separately, Johnson also reiterated that the state-run National Health Service is “not for sale” in any free-trade deal with the U.S. Labour wants election, but Not Yet, Corbyn Says (4:45 p.m.) labour leader Jeremy Corbyn held his line that an election should only take place once the risk of a no-deal Brexit has gone. “This crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government’s threat of a disastrous No Deal is taken off the table,” Corbyn said in a speech to Labour’s annual conference. “After what has taken place no one can trust this government and this Prime Minister not to use this crisis of their own making and drive our country over a No Deal cliff edge in five weeks’ time,” Corbyn said. Johnson Says U.K. Needs General Election (2:30 p.m.) Johnson told reporters in New York the U.K. needs a general election. He criticized opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has resisted demands for a snap poll -- because he doesn’t trust Johnson not to use it to force through a no-deal Brexit. “Jeremy Corbyn is talking out of the back of his head and we must have an election,” Johnson said. The prime minister will hold a conference call with Cabinet ministers at 6 p.m. before his speech to the United Nations. He will then fly back to the U.K. Delivering a speech earlier to business leaders, Johnson reiterated that he disagrees with the Supreme Court’s judgment. “We in the U.K. will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the EU on Oct. 31,” he said. “Because that it was we were mandated to do.” Johnson’s Office Says He Won’t Resign (1:30 p.m.) Johnson’s office, briefing reporters in New York City, insisted the prime minister will not resign, despite calls from opposition parties (see 11:10 a.m.). Johnson will return to the U.K. after delivering his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, scheduled for 8 p.m. local time, they said. Johnson Pledges to ‘Get On’ With Brexit (1:15 p.m.) Speaking in New York City, where he is due to address the United Nations General Assembly, Johnson stood by his commitment to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31, blaming the claimants who brought the case to the Supreme Court for seeking to “frustrate” Brexit. “Obviously this is a verdict that we will respect and we respect the judicial process,” Johnson said in a pooled TV interview. “I have to say that I strongly disagree with what the justices have found. I don’t think that it’s right but we will go ahead and of course Parliament will come back.” “The most important thing is we get on and deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 and clearly the claimants in this case are determined to frustrate that and to stop that,” Johnson said. “I think it would be very unfortunate if Parliament made that objective which the people want more difficult, but we will get on.” Corbyn to Give Speech This Afternoon (12:45 p.m.) Jeremy Corbyn’s office confirmed to journalists in Brighton that the opposition leader will make his conference speech at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, a day earlier than scheduled. Deputy Leader Tom Watson -- who had been due to speak on Tuesday afternoon -- would now speak place on Wednesday, they said. But Watson -- who was subject to an attempt by Corbyn supporters to abolish his position at the start of the party’s conference -- tweeted that he wouldn’t make the speech. “I will be with all Labour colleagues in Parliament tomorrow,” Watson wrote. “I’ll have to save the speech until the next conference.” Parliament to Resume Wednesday: Bercow (12:20 p.m.) Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said the House of Commons will meet at 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday. He emphasized it would not be a recall, but a “resumption” because the Supreme Court ruled suspension unlawful. There will be no Prime Minister’s Questions, a usual fixture on the agenda on Wednesdays, but Bercow said “for the avoidance of doubt, there will be full scope for urgent questions, ministerial statements and applications for emergency debates.” Emergency debates are what Members of Parliament used to seize control of the agenda earlier this month to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn Moves Speech Forward to Tuesday (12:15 p.m.) After Parliament was recalled to sit on Wednesday, Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his speech to the party’s annual conference on Tuesday, his office said in Brighton. Corbyn had been due to speak on Wednesday. No time was given for the rescheduled speech. ‘Perfectly Obvious’ Johnson Was Lying: Grieve (11:50 a.m.) Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who was kicked out of the parliamentary Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Brexit, said it was “perfectly obvious” that the prime minister’s stated reason for suspending Parliament was “bogus and untrue.” “I’m not surprised by the judgment because of the gross misbehavior by the prime minister,” Grieve told the BBC. “He should be pausing and reflecting on the untold damage he is doing to our institutions.” Farage Turns Fire on Johnson’s Key Adviser (11:40 a.m.) Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, after the Supreme Court ruled the suspension of Parliament for five weeks was unlawful. “The calling of a Queen’s Speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go,” Farage said on Twitter. Cummings has been a lightning rod for criticism of Johnson and has been criticized by opposition lawmakers, as well as some from the prime minister’s Conservative Party, for overseeing an uncompromising hard-Brexit operation in Johnson’s office. Rudd: PM Withheld Legal Advice from Cabinet (11:35 a.m.) Amber Rudd, who quit Boris Johnson’s government this month after accusing him of not working toward a deal with the European Union, said the prime minister had not shown the legal advice on suspending Parliament to the rest of the Cabinet. “This is an astonishing moment and I regret that the PM, who entered office with such goodwill, went down this route,” Rudd said on Twitter, urging Johnson to “work with Parliament” to pass a Brexit deal. EU Not Commenting on U.K. Court Ruling (11:15 a.m.) The European Commission won’t comment on the U.K.’s “internal constitutional matters,” its spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud told reporters in Brussels. “Our interlocutor remains the government of the U.K.,” she said. Calls Mounting for Johnson to Resign (11:10 a.m.) Other party leaders backed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s call for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign. “Boris Johnson isn’t fit to be prime minister,” Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said on Twitter. “He’s misled Queen and country, and unlawfully silenced the people’s representatives. I’m on my way to resume my duties in the Commons and stop Brexit altogether.” Liz Saville Roberts, leader of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, said: “There is no question, the prime minister must resign immediately and a crash out Brexit stopped once and for all.” The Scottish Nationalist Party’s Joanna Cherry said if Johnson “had a shred of integrity, he would jump before he is pushed.” Corbyn Says Johnson Should Quit (11:05 a.m.) Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded Parliament be recalled and called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign after announcing the Supreme Court’s verdict to a standing ovation from delegates at his party’s annual conference in Brighton. “It demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him,” Corbyn said. He said he’d be in touch immediately with House of Commons Speaker John Bercow “to demand that Parliament is recalled so that we can question that prime minister and demand that he obeys the law that’s been passed by Parliament.” Corbyn then invited Johnson “to consider his position” to a further standing ovation and chants of “Johnson Out!” from the delegates. Bercow: Parliament Must Reconvene Without Delay (11 a.m.) Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow called for Parliament to reconvene. “As the embodiment of our Parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay,” Bercow said in a statement. “ To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency.” Court Says Parliament Suspension ‘Unlawful’ (10:45 a.m.) The U.K.’s top judges dealt an unprecedented legal rebuke to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, branding his controversial decision to suspend Parliament unlawful. Parliament must decide what happens next and should meet as soon as possible, judge Brenda Hale said in unanimous ruling. The landmark decision Tuesday is a boost for MPs seeking to prevent Johnson pulling the country out of the European Union by Oct. 31 without a deal. By limiting the prime minister’s power to suspend Parliament in the future, the judges also deprived Johnson of one of his last weapons to force through Brexit before his self-imposed deadline. The decision to prorogue parliament was “unlawful, void and no effect” Judge Brenda Hale, president of the Supreme Court, said in the decision. “The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification,” she said. No Evidence of Criminality by Brexit Campaign Group (10 a.m.) The U.K.’s National Crime Agency said it found no evidence of criminality after investigating possible offenses around foreign involvement in funding for the 2016 EU referendum campaign. Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and the businessman Arron Banks will face no further action, the agency said. Even so, election watchdog the Electoral Commission said in a statement: “We are concerned about the apparent weakness in the law, highlighted by this investigation outcome, which allows overseas funds into U.K. politics.” Labour’s Long-Bailey Keeps ‘Leave’ Option Open (9:30 a.m.) Labour’s Business spokeswoman Rebecca Long-Bailey suggested the party could campaign for ‘Leave’ in a second referendum if it secures the right deal with the European Union after winning a general election. In a Bloomberg TV interview, she denied the party has a “wait-and-see” approach, saying Labour wants a “credible” Brexit deal. “The decision that was made yesterday at conference, that was about assessing that final deal and determining as a party how we would campaign in such a people’s vote,” Long-Bailey said. The assessment of the deal is needed because “it could be 70% of what we’ve asked for; it could be 50% of what we’ve asked for, it could be 100%.” In a speech to the party’s conference Tuesday, Long-Bailey will announce a ramp up in spending on electric vehicles and offshore wind if Labour comes to power. Labour will spend 3.6 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) to expand the electric vehicle charging network, as well as offering 2.5 million people interest free loans to help buy electric cars. She’ll also announce plans to build 37 offshore wind farms, with the government holding a 51% stake, according to Labour. Leadsom: We’ll Obey Law But Seek to Leave on Time (Earlier) Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom insisted the government will abide by the law blocking a no-deal Brexit, but will still seek to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 even if Boris Johnson can’t reach a new Brexit deal. “There’s a huge amount of work to negotiate a deal,” Leadsom said in an interview with BBC Radio. “Should we not get a deal, then we will be seeking to leave the European Union without a deal on the Oct. 31, but we will of course, always, abide by the law. The government always abides by the law.” She didn’t say how it would be possible to both abide by the law -- which says the prime minister must seek an extension from the EU by Oct. 19 if he can’t reach a deal -- while also leaving without a deal on Oct. 31. “We had a referendum over three years ago now, we’ve got to get on and deliver on it and Boris Johnson is the only person who is going to do that,” she said.

The strikes came four days after the Houthis, a group aligned with Iran, said they would stop aiming missile and drone attacks at Saudi Arabia if the Saudi-led coalition targeting Yemen does the same. The coalition spokesman said later on Tuesday that Houthi forces fired a ballistic missile from Amran, northwest of the capital Sanaa, but it fell inside Houthi territory in Yemen. The Houthis this month claimed an assault on Saudi oil facilities which initially halved the kingdom's production. Washington and Riyadh blame Iran for that attack. Al-Masirah TV said 16 people in one building - including seven children - died in strikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition. There was no immediate comment from the coalition. Saudi Arabia leads a coalition that intervened in 2015 to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which the Houthis ousted from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014. It has carried out many air strikes in Houthi areas. Two residents told Reuters that 17 people had died in the strikes on Qataba, a frontline town which lies on the main north-south route between Houthi-controlled Sanaa and the southern port city of Aden. Aden is nominally the interim seat of Yemen's internationally recognised government, but southern separatists seized control of the city last month. Violence from both sides during the war has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine. Nine people, including three children, died this month when shelling from Houthi-controlled territory hit their house south of the major port city of Hodeidah, medical sources told Reuters. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said eight women and one child had been admitted to a nearby hospital after shelling.

The gold weighed approximately 230 pounds and has ""an estimated value of around $5 million,"" the document read. Sanchez Rojas, 42, said that he ""had obtained the gold from multiple sources in Venezuela"" with the intention of selling it in the United States. Upon landing in Fort Lauderdale -- located 31 miles (50 kilometers) north of Miami -- Sanchez Rojas and his wife filled out a customs declaration form stating that they were carrying $24,000, ""but did not declare any other items."" He also said that ""he knew the organization had smuggled gold previously into the US and that he would receive a fee for his involvement with the gold smuggling."" Fossi Grieco, the 51 year-old pilot, said that he had met people in Venezuela to pick up the gold and that he stored it in the plane's nose for two days before the flight. He added that he was going to receive a commission once he delivered the gold.

Mandy Pursley shared photos of herself all dressed up as Cinderella, adding an inventive twist on the classic Disney princess: Instead of the character's iconic glass slipper, Pursley is wearing a specially made glass prosthetic arm. Pursley and her husband Ryan, who dressed as Prince Charming for the photoshoot, even recreated the scene where Cinderella loses her slipper at the ball — with Ryan chasing after her and waving the glass arm in the air.  In a post that has since been shared over 25,000 times, Pursley explained the motivation behind her creative cosplay.  ""When my daughter was studying Cinderella stories at school last year, I realized that even though there were so many beautiful tales from around the world, there were still no princesses who looked like ME!"" she wrote on Facebook. ""When I was growing up with a physical difference, I never saw girls like myself represented in the media, so it took me a long time to realize that what makes us different can also be the thing that makes us strong, beautiful, and unapologetically unique."" Pursley also explained that she had been saving the photos to compete in a costume contest next summer after a ""medical fiasco"" prevented her from entering a competition this year. But she said was spurred to post them now instead, after a friend asked her if she had any pictures she could share with a little girl who was born with one arm.  ""I realized that we never know what the future may hold... but we can still bring joy to people today!"" she wrote.  After her post went viral, Pursley shared an update, saying she couldn't believe the overwhelming response her photos had received from strangers around the world.  Her favorite part, she added, was seeing photos of ""little 'lucky fin' princesses and princes"" in the comments, sharing their own stories and photos of their physical differences. ""Please shower these kids with all the love too because they are adorable and awesome exactly the way they are!"" Pursley wrote. ""I know they are going to write some great stories one day too!"" Pursley has now created a fan page called Be the Spark Cosplay, where she says she hopes to ""use cosplay and art as a means to highlight the beauty of our differences"" and celebrate ""people who break out of the mold and create characters that inspire others to do the same."""
33,russia-one-way-kill-u-000000579.html,Russia Has One Way to Find and Kill U.S. F-22 and F-35 Stealth Fighters,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:00:00 -0400",Can they pull it off?,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-one-way-kill-u-000000579.html,"Key point: Detecting stealth is possible, but very, very hard. Ever since the development of stealth technology for aircraft, many different systems have been advertised as “stealth killing.” One of the more innovative solutions is the Russian Struna-1/Barrier-E bistatic radar system developed by NNIIRT, a division of the Almaz-Antey Joint Stock Company. Almaz-Antey is the premier air-defense and radar manufacturer in Russia; they make the Tor, Buk and S-400 anti-aircraft systems, as well as their respective search radars. The Struna-1 was originally developed in 1999. A further evolution of Struna-1, the Barrier-E system was later showcased for export at MAKS 2007. While it is not part of Almaz-Antey’s online catalog, it was shown alongside other radars at MAKS 2017. The system is rumored to be deployed around Moscow. The Struna-1 is different than most radars in that it is a bistatic radar, meaning it relies on the receiver and transmitter of the radar to be in two different locations as opposed to conventional radar technology where the receiver and transmitter are located in the same location. Normal radar systems are limited by the inverse fourth power law. As the radar target goes further away from the transmission source, the strength of the radar signal decays as per the regular inverse square law. However, radar detection works by receiving reflections of the radar signal. With a conventional radar, this results in the received signal being four times weaker than that put out. Stealth works because at a distance, an aircraft can mitigate its radar returns to be small by scattering them and absorbing them using radiation-absorbent materials. This degrades the quality of the radar track so it is harder to distinguish precise information about an aircraft. How America Could Go to War with Iran The Struna-1 solves this problem by positioning the transmitter in a different location than the receiver. The link between the transmitter and receiver has increased power relative to a conventional radar, as it falls off according to the inverse square law as opposed to the inverse fourth power law. This allows the radar to be more sensitive, as it is effectively acting as a radar tripwire. According to Russian sources, this setup increases the effective radar cross section (RCS) of a target by nearly threefold, and ignores any anti-radar coatings that can scatter the radio waves. This allows the detection of not only stealth aircraft, but other objects with low RCS such as hang gliders and cruise missiles. As many of ten receiver/transmitter tower pairs—each tower is called Priyomno-Peredayushchiy Post (PPP) in Russian publications—can be placed. Sources vary in potential configurations of the towers, but the maximum span between two single towers is 50km. This leads to a maximum theoretical perimeter of 500km. Why North Korea's Air Force is Total Junk  These individual towers have relatively low power consumption, and they do not emit as much energy as traditional radars, making them less vulnerable to anti-radiation weapons. The towers are mobile, allowing for forward deployment in times of conflict. They rely on microwave data links to communicate with each other and a centralized monitoring station, which can be located at a significant distance from the system. The distributed nature also allows the system to keep operating if one node goes down, albeit with less precision. The low height of the transmitter and receiver towers (only 25m off the ground) make Struna-1 very good at detecting low altitude targets, a target set that conventional radars often have trouble with. Why Doesn't America Kill Kim Jong Un?  Limitations of the Struna-1 include a low detection altitude. The nature of the system results in the detection range being a rough biased parabola between the receiver and transmitter. This limits the detection altitude to around 7km at the tallest point, with the maximum detection range going down as one gets closer to the transmitter/receiver towers. The transverse size of the detection zone is likewise limited, being around 1.5km close to the towers to 12km at the optimal point between the towers. The small size of the detection zone limits the use of the Struna-1 system as a tripwire, it cannot replace traditional radars as an overall search mechanism. However with its high precision tracks of stealthy aircraft, it would serve as a good counterpart to other longer-band radar systems such as Sunflower, which provide less precise tracks of planes. The Struna-1 cannot act as a targeting radar due to its inability to provide constant radar illumination tracking a target, so it cannot be used to guide in semi-active surface-to-air missiles. While the Struna-1 bistatic radar is not a be-all end-all detection solution for stealth aircraft, it could pose a significant threat to stealth NATO aircraft in a future conflict. Strike aircraft with stealth features are particularly vulnerable, the strike role tends to favor flight profiles that might cause aircraft to fly into the Struna-1’s detection range. In tandem with other modern “stealth-defeating” radar systems, the Struna-1 could provide critical information to an adversary on the position and movement of stealth aircraft.

He is the second parent to be sentenced in Boston federal court in the nation's college admissions scandal after actress Felicity Huffman received 14 days in prison this month. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani also sentenced Sloane to two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and a $95,000 fine.  ""Just because you’re a good person doesn’t mean you don’t commit a crime when you do those things,"" Talwani said. “I come back to the action you took in bribing a college official. Bribing a college official is a serious crime. You are not a repeat player, but what you did involved your child."" Sloane, 53, is the founder and CEO of waterTALENT, a water treatment company. The judge ordered him to report to prison Dec. 3.  Sloane and his team of attorneys declined to comment leaving the courthouse.  The longer prison term for Sloane compared to Huffman means parents who took part in the recruitment plot rather than the testing scam could be in line for tougher sentences. Parents made larger payments to Rick Singer, the admissions scheme's mastermind, to participate in the recruitment plot, which guaranteed a seat at a college or university. Federal prosecutors had recommended that Sloane receive one year and a day in prison in addition to a $75,000 fine and 12 months of supervised release. Sloane's lawyers said he should be sentenced to 2,000 hours of community service instead of prison and proposed he launch and oversee a Special Olympics initiative at independent schools.    The judge rejected that idea, noting that Sloane has an exemplary record of community service. ""I think those are very good characteristics,"" she said. ""But I don’t understand how it’s punitive.""  ""I don’t think that independent school children is the focus of this case,"" Talwani said when Sloane's lead attorney, Nathan Hochman, suggested the proposal could be a way to help students harmed in the college admission case. ""That’s about as tone-deaf as I’ve heard."" .oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;} California businessman Devin Sloane and his attorneys declined to comment to reporters after he was sentenced just now to 4 months in prison for paying $250K go get his son accepted into @USC as a fake water polo recruit. pic.twitter.com/VZ61r4kAjz More: What Felicity Huffman's prison sentence means for other parents in college admissions scandal In a deal with prosecutors, Sloane pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.  Sloane choked up addressing the judge Tuesday and apologized to his family and the judge. “There are no words to justify my behavior,"" he said, adding that he takes ""complete responsibility"" for his actions. ""Some people see this as a case of privilege and arrogance. In my heart and soul, I wanted what was best for my son. I now realize this was the antitheses of that."" But Talwani pushed back, making a statement about the entire admissions scandal.  “I find that’s at issue in all of these cases. It’s not basic care-taking for your child. It’s not getting your child food or clothing. It’s not even getting your child an education. It’s getting your child into a college that you call ‘exclusive.’” ""Are they doing this for their children or their own status?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen argued Sloane’s conduct was “far more egregious” than Huffman’s, noting he paid “17 times the bribe amount” to Singer. Rosen argued Sloane did not accept responsibility like Huffman did.   “Huffman has owned her criminal activity, while the defendant attacked the victim and blamed others,” Rosen said. He argued Sloane's proposal for significant community service would not be available to the poor and middle class.    “Make no mistake, he is using his wealth to attempt to buy his way out of jail,” Rosen said. “Prison is necessary here as a great leveler between rich and poor, and that’s why the defendant is doing everything possible here to avoid it.” According to prosecutors, Sloane paid $200,000 to Singer's sham nonprofit group, the Key Worldwide Foundation, and $50,000 to USC Women's Athletics through Donna Heinel, a former senior associate athletic director at USC, who has pleaded not guilty to charges. The payments came in 2017 and 2018 after Sloane's son was fraudulently admitted to USC as an internationally accomplished water polo recruit – which he was not.  Hochman told the judge Sloane was a ""good man who made a mistake"" and that 2,000 hours of community service would be unprecedented, making it an appropriate punishment instead of prison. But Talwani interjected at several moments to disagree with his defense, including when Hochman disputed that Sloane knew Heinel received bribe money. He said his client did not know what Singer did with the money.   “Your client didn’t know how the messy details were being worked out,"" Talwani said. ""But he understood the money was being used to bribe a USC official."" Hochman painted Singer as a ""world-class scheme and manipulator"" and suggested that Sloane would not have committed the crime if not for Singer. That also drew sharp disagreement from the judge. ""Why is that the question?"" Talwani said, noting that she has defendants come before her court regularly who have been offered a “financial route” to sell drugs or commit other crimes. “Why does it matter that somebody invited him?” Fifty-two defendants, including 35 parents, were charged with crimes in the nation's ""Varsity Blues"" college admissions scheme. Twenty-three defendants pleaded guilty to felonies; the remaining pleaded not guilty. The government has pushed for longer prison terms for parents, such as Sloane, who made among the largest payments in the scheme. In contrast, Huffman paid $15,000 to have someone correct answers on the SAT exam for her oldest daughter. Prosecutors sought one month of prison for Huffman. More: Felicity Huffman sentenced: 2 weeks in prison, $30,000 fine for college admissions scandal A ruling earlier this month from Talwani on which federal sentencing guidelines to use might have led to a lighter prison term than prosecutors had sought for Sloane. The judge decided the federal fraud statute should set the base level for sentences of parents in the admissions case. The government requested the tougher commercial bribery statue to apply. More: Felicity Huffman is just the beginning: Who's pleaded guilty in the college admissions scandal – and who's still fighting The college admissions case continues Thursday in Boston federal court when Stephen Semprevivo, a former executive at Cydcor, is scheduled to be sentenced. Semprevivo admitted paying $400,000 for his son to be admitted into Georgetown University as a fake tennis recruit. Semprevivo's legal team watched Sloane's hearing from inside the courtroom.

FBI spokesman John Althen said the agents were in the building for ""law enforcement activity"" but declined to elaborate. Multiple media outlets reported that the raids were conducted at Sen. Martin Sandoval's Capitol office in Springfield, his district office in the Chicago suburb of Cicero and his Chicago home. The Chicago Tribune reported that a man who answered the door at Sandoval's home said he was not home. The suite door to Sandoval's office would not open when an Associated Press reporter tried to enter at around the time the raid was taking place. Attempts to reach Sandoval by phone were unsuccessful. Several men in dark suits and ties could be seen walking from the Senate Democrats' side of the Capitol, carrying the bags and boxes of materials. The word ""evidence"" could be seen written across at least one of the bags. Photos from some media outlets also showed people carrying boxes from his home. Sandoval, 55, has served in the Senate since 2003, representing a district on Chicago's southwest side. He is chairman of the powerful Transportation Committee and was a driving force behind a 19-cents-a-gallon increase in the gas tax to help fund Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker's $45 billion capital construction plan to rebuild roads, bridges and schools. Republicans criticized him in August when a photo from a fundraiser appeared on social media showing what appeared to be a mock assassination of President Donald Trump.

He expressed ""my deepest regret that this unfortunate incident took place at (an) event in my name."" It wasn't clear whether Sandoval's work on the gas tax plan or his fundraiser had anything to do with the raids.

But right-wing Likud party chief Netanyahu, facing a looming indictment on corruption allegations he denies, still has no clear path to a fifth term after emerging from the Sept. 17 ballot, the second this year, short of a parliamentary majority. Accepting the mandate from President Reuven Rivlin at a televised ceremony, a politically weakened Netanyahu said his chances of success were only marginally higher than those of Gantz, a former general who heads the Blue and White party. In his remarks, Netanyahu seemed to envision a scenario in which he and Gantz would be able to take another stab at power-sharing once it became clear there was no way out of the current deadlock, save for a third election that few in Israel wanted. ""If I don't succeed, I will return the mandate to you and with the help of God and Israel's citizens and yourself, Mr President, we will establish a broad national unity government down the line,"" he said. Netanyahu, 69 and Israel's longest-serving leader, will have 28 days to form a coalition and can ask Rivlin for a two-week extension if necessary. Netanyahu's failure to clinch victory in a ballot in April led to last week's election. Rivlin, in his remarks, pointedly noted that he is under no obligation to grant his prime minister-designate that two-week extension to establish a governing coalition. Nor did he commit to turning to Gantz if Netanyahu failed to break the current deadlock. Under law, Rivlin can assign the coalition-building task to any member of parliament he deems likely to succeed, or he can ask the legislature to pick someone. With final results announced on Wednesday, Likud has the pledged support of 55 legislators in the 120-member parliament, against 54 for Blue and White. The two parties failed to reach a coalition deal in talks launched on Tuesday. Former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, a possible kingmaker, has been keeping his far-right Yisrael Beitenu party on the fence since the Sept. 17 ballot, citing differences with Likud's ultra-Orthodox religious partners and Blue and White's left-wing allies. ""It became clear that neither Netanyahu nor Gantz had the 61 seats necessary to form a government,"" Rivlin said at the ceremony. ""Netanyahu's ability to assemble an administration is higher at the moment,"" the president said, noting that 10 Arab legislators in Gantz's support bloc of 54, who recommended he nominate the ex-general, did not commit to joining a government. Rivlin had until next Wednesday to announce his choice, but the Likud-Blue and White unity talks showed no sign of progress. A deal in which Netanyahu and Gantz would take turns as prime minister was widely mooted. But in his campaign, Gantz pledged not serve in a government with Netanyahu, citing the Israeli leader's legal troubles. And Gantz's deputies in Blue and White also voiced their strong opposition while the unity talks were under way. Next month, Israel’s attorney-general will hold a pre-trial hearing on his announced intention to indict the Israeli leader on fraud and bribery charges in three corruption cases. Netanyahu, who says he is a victim of a political witch-hunt, can argue at the session against being charged. As prime minister, Netanyahu would be under no legal obligation to resign if formal charges were filed. But any other cabinet post might not offer him that protection.  (Editing by Alex Richardson)"

This is what the US has in the skies.",https://news.yahoo.com/heres-us-air-force-planned-185620085.html,"REUTERS/Cherie A. Thurlby/U.S. Air Force CAT/GN  The US has three bombers — the B-1B Lancer, the stealth B-2 Spirit, and the B-52 Stratofortress — to deliver thousands of tons of firepower in combat. Some form of the B-52 has been in use since 1955. The B-1B took its first flight in 1974, and the B-2 celebrated its 30th year in the skies in 2019. A new stealth bomber, the B-21, is in production and is expected to fly in December 2021, although details about it are scarce. The US Air Force has been conducting missions in Europe with B-52s and B-2s in order to project dominance against Russia and train with NATO partners, but the bomber fleet has faced problems. The B-1B fleet struggled with low readiness rates, as Air Force Times reported in June, likely due to its age and overuse in recent conflicts. Here are all the bombers in the US Air Force's fleet. US Air Force The Lancer is a long-range, multi-role heavy bomber and has been in service since 1985, although its predecessor, the B-1A, was developed in the 1970s as a replacement for the B-52. The B-1B is built by Boeing and has a payload of 90,000 pounds. The Air Force is also looking at ways to expand that payload to carry more weapons and heavier weapons, including hypersonics. The Lancer has a wingspan of 137 feet, a ceiling of 30,000 feet, and can hit speeds up to Mach 1.2, according to the Air Force. There are 62 B-1Bs currently in service.  US Air Force/Staff Sgt. Peter Reft The B-1B is not scheduled to retire until 2036, but constant deployments to the Middle East between 2006 and 2016 ""broke"" the fleet. Service officials and policymakers are now considering whether the Lancer can be kept flying missions, when it should retire, and what that means for the bomber fleet as a whole.  U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Ralph Hallmon/AP The Air Force's longest-serving bomber came into service in 1955 as the B-52A. The Air Force now flies the B-52H Stratofortress, which arrived in 1961. It has flown missions in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm and during operations against ISIS. The B-52H Stratofortress can carry a 70,000 pound payload, including up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles, and can fly at 650 mph. It also recently dropped laser-guided bombs for the first time in a decade. The Stratofortress is expected to be in service through 2050, and the Air Force has several upgrades planned, including new engines, a new radar, and a new nuclear weapon.  Edwards Air Force Base Two B-52s have returned to service from 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, also known as the ""boneyard,"" where retired or mothballed aircraft are stored. One bomber, nicknamed ""Ghost Rider"" returned in 2015, and the other, ""Wise Guy,"" in May. ""Wise Guy,"" a Stratofortress brought to Barksdale Air Force Bease in Louisiana to be refurbished, had a note scribbled in its cockpit, calling the aircraft, ""a cold warrior that stood sentinel over America from the darkest days of the Cold War to the global fight against terror"" and instructing the AMARG to ""take good care of her … until we need her again.""  Wikimedia Commons The B-2 was developed in a shroud of secrecy by Northrop Grumman. It is a multi-role bomber, capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. It has a payload of 40,000 pounds and has been in operational use since 1993. July was the 30th anniversary of the B-2's first flight, and the Air Force currently has 20 of them.  US Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Matthew Plew The B-2 operates out of Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, and three of the bombers are currently flying out of RAF Fairford in the UK. From Fairford, the B-2 has completed several firsts this year — the first time training with non-US F-35s, its first visit to Iceland, and its first extended flight over the Arctic.  US Air Force What we do know: It will be a stealth aircraft capable of carrying nuclear and conventional weapons. Built by Northrop Grumman, the B-21 is named for Doolittle's Raiders, the crews who flew a daring bomb raid on Japan just a few months after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The Air Force said last year that B-21s would go to three bases when they start arriving in the mid-2020s: Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, and Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.  Northrup Grumman Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Stephen Wilson said on July 24 that he has an application on his phone ""counting down the days … and don't hold me to it, but it's something like 863 days to first flight,"" according to Air Force Magazine. The B-21 also loomed over the B-2's 30th anniversary celebrations at Northrop's facility in Palmdale, California, where the B-2 was built and first flew.  Company officials have said work on the B-2 is informing the B-21's development, and recently constructed buildings at Northrop's Site 7 are thought to be linked to the B-21.   "

""I dedicate this award to all those Indians who transformed the 'Clean India Mission' into a people's movement and started giving cleanliness the highest priority in their daily lives,"" Modi said after collecting the award from billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. India's government says it has built more than 100 million toilets under a $20 billion initiative begun in 2014 to address the issue of open defecation, particularly in rural areas, a major public health issue in the country. Under Modi's plan, tribal households get $200 each for building latrines. But ahead of the ceremony, Nobel Peace Prize winners Mairead Maguire, Tawakkol Abdel-Salam Karman and Shirin Ebadi said that under Modi's leadership, ""India has descended into dangerous and deadly chaos that has consistently undermined human rights, democracy. ""This is particularly troubling to us as the stated mission of your foundation is to preserve life and fight inequity,"" they wrote, urging the Gates Foundation to change its decision. In addition to a rise in mob lynchings of Muslims, Christians, and Dalits, they noted the decision by Genocide Watch to issue warnings for the state of Assam and Indian-administered Kashmir. The disputed territory is under a communications blackout that has lasted 50 days after Modi rescinded its autonomy. The award was also protested in an online petition that garnered 100,000 signatures as well as a comment piece co-authored by feminist leader Gloria Steinem. Modi won a second term in a huge election victory in May and drew tens of thousands of diaspora fans on Sunday in an unusual joint rally in Houston with President Donald Trump. He did not respond to the criticism over the award. The Gates Foundation told AFP in a statement: ""Before the Swachh Bharat mission, over 500 million people in India did not have access to safe sanitation, and now, the majority do. ""The Swachh Bharat Mission can serve as a model for other countries around the world that urgently need to improve access to sanitation for the world's poorest."""

Miller revealed that she learned that Brock Turner had sexually assaulted her not from a police officer, nurse, or counselor, but from reading a news article more than a week after the assault. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, Chanel Miller, the woman who was sexually assaulted by the Stanford swimmer Brock Turner at a fraternity party in 2015, said she didn't learn his name or what he did to her until reading a news article about the incident more than a week later. AP/Santa Clara County Sheriff While she was told at the hospital that she may have been sexually assaulted and was asked to undergo a rape kit, Miller didn't learn many of the details of that night until 10 days later, she said. Having no memory of the assault, Miller wasn't even certain that anything criminal had happened, since all she was told was that she was found behind a dumpster and that somebody had been chased down and arrested. ""I just thought I had passed out somewhere and that there was a suspicious man at the party who had been behaving in an odd way,"" she told ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday. ""I had no idea he was directly connected to me in any way."" She said authorities initially left out the detail that her underwear and cellphone had been found on the ground near her. Miller's sister picked her up from the hospital, and they decided not to tell their parents or anyone else what happened until they got more information. For 10 long days, Miller went to work and waited to hear more. On the 10th day, a news story popped up on her feed about Turner's arrest on charges of sexual assault. She hadn't heard Turner's name before, but after reading about the victim in the story, she knew it was her. It was also the first time she learned that he had sexually assaulted her.

41,giuliani-hunted-corruption-now-legal-191552780.html,Giuliani Hunted Corruption. Now the Legal Peril May Be His,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:54:44 -0400","(Bloomberg) -- Rudy Giuliani, once a feared prosecutor who has relentlessly defended President Donald Trump as his personal lawyer, could now have legal woes of his own.In a call with Ukraine’s president, Trump said multiple times that Giuliani was acting on his behalf. Since the president has plenty of Justice Department officials to tap, questions arise about whether Giuliani was primarily pursuing a political goal abroad.Giuliani, who has deep ties to Ukraine and many business connections there, has openly pushed for Ukrainian officials to investigate not just corruption in general, but specifically the actions of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.“Any objective, non-partisan Department of Justice would already be investigating Giuliani, who has gotten on TV and admitted things that, standing alone, raise serious concerns about violations of criminal laws,” said Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor now at Pace University’s law school.Former federal prosecutors pointed to several possible lines of criminal inquiry, based on facts that have already become public, that could entangle Giuliani:Did he try to solicit something of value for Trump -- such as information that could damage a political opponent -- from a foreign party, in violation of federal election law?Did he engage in bribery by suggesting something of value -- like military aid to Ukraine -- in exchange for a Ukrainian investigation that could involve the Bidens?Did he step into a U.S. foreign policy dispute as a private citizen, which could violate the Logan Act?Was he a co-conspirator in a broader effort to defraud the U.S. by attempting to interfere in the 2020 presidential election?Even if prosecutors in Trump’s Justice Department don’t take up the matter, the Congressional impeachment inquiry will likely drill down on Giuliani’s actions and communications.The conversation between Trump and the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, suggests a bribery or extortion scheme involving Giuliani, said Barbara McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former federal prosecutor. She pointed out that the U.S. president asked for a political favor immediately after Zelenskiy discussed buying more U.S.-supplied Javelin anti-tank missiles.In effect, Trump is saying “I want you to do this favor for me before I give you what you want,” McQuade said.The repeated references to Giuliani suggest he could be co-conspirator in a scheme involving the president, she said. Although the Justice Department has said Trump can’t be indicted while in office, Giuliani has no such protection.“The invocation of Giuliani, who’s not a government official and is Trump’s private attorney, strikes me as bribery or extortion and absolutely an abuse of presidential power,” she said. The actions suggest Trump was going outside official channels because he knew it looked shady, she added.Read more: Text of memorandum on Trump-Zelinskiy callSome of those troubled by Giuliani’s behavior noted that it could be hard to use Trump’s phone call to help establish a corrupt scheme.“I don’t think it’s a clear case of bribery or extortion because the government would have to convince a jury that in a long, rambling conversation where they talked at multiple points about U.S. assistance to Ukraine and other topics, the president also asks for a favor,” said Patrick Cotter, a former prosecutor now in private practice in Chicago.Rocah echoed McQuade that the call suggests a broader scheme involving Giuliani. She raised the possibility of a conspiracy to defraud the U.S., a wide-ranging statute that special counsel Robert Mueller used to bring charges against Russian nationals who allegedly interfered in the 2016 election.If there were any merit to the underlying allegations about Biden and his son, then the U.S. Justice Department, and not Giuliani, should be investigating, Rocah added.Like several others, she said Giuliani and Trump had something other than Ukrainian corruption on their minds. “This idea, that Trump would personally ask the president of another country to work on an investigation that’s in the interest of the U.S., it’s so obviously not what was happening,” she said.Others said the use of Giuliani for an official purpose was problematic from the outset, complicated by the delay in U.S. aid for Ukraine.John Moscow, who was a senior prosecutor in the office of former Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, said there’s nothing wrong with Giuliani asking Ukraine for help for his client. But he added: “When the government of the U.S. takes the position that financial aid depends on how Ukraine responds to that personal request, that’s a conflation of Trump’s personal and government jobs, which is not proper.”Giuliani didn’t respond to requests for comment. “No quid pro quo,” the onetime New York City mayor tweeted Wednesday, “just an agreement on both sides to fully investigate very serious allegations regarding corruption at the highest levels of both countries. Now, are we ever going to investigate Biden?”Trading favors isn’t the only potential problem. Giuliani’s conduct could be in violation of the 1799 Logan Act, said Moscow and McQuade. The law forbids U.S. citizens from engaging in any “unauthorized” negotiations with foreign governments. “We want the government to act and not people who are running around winging it,” McQuade said.U.S. foreign-lobbying laws could also apply. Seven Democratic Senators on Wednesday urged the Justice Department to review whether Giuliani has complied with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA.At the least, Congress will examine Giuliani’s myriad public statements and actions for what light they shed on the president himself. Lawmakers may find it hard to separate his work for the president from his many business deals in Ukraine, with extensive contacts.“It makes him a witness, at a minimum, in a criminal investigation or an impeachment inquiry,” said Cotter.For example, Giuliani said this week that the State Department urged him to get information about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Investigators will likely want to see any supporting communications on that subject.Two Soviet-born businessman who Giuliani has publicly identified as his clients have played key roles as back channels to Ukrainian figures.

And if the request was political in nature, it’s not protected. “Political instruction is not legal advice,” said Moscow. “It’s not privileged.”Whether the White House will attempt to invoke some form of executive privilege over its communications with Giuliani isn’t known.

The former officer said the reason for having the items is his love for history and a classic TV show.  Muskegon City Manager Frank Peterson and the city attorney's office  released a 421-page report on the investigation of Charles Anderson, as well as his history as a police officer before he was fired.  According to the report, Robert Mathis toured Anderson's home with his family and a real estate agent Aug. 7. He posted a picture on Facebook of a framed KKK application he found. Mathis said in the post that he and his wife, Reyna, had been house hunting for more than a month and thought the house ""would be perfect"" for them. He mentioned seeing Confederate flags on the walls, dining room table and garage.  Wildfire threats loom: California utility cuts power to more than 20,000 customers In an interview with the city, Anderson confirmed that he had a Confederate flag hanging in his garage, a flag-decorated hot pad on his dining room table and a framed, blank copy of a KKK application from the 1920s.  He said the flags are part of his extensive ""Dukes of Hazzard"" collection. Anderson ""loves everything"" about the show and has been to the fan convention, Duke Fest, several times.  Anderson said the reason for the KKK application is related to his passion for U.S. history from the late 1800s to the 1960s. He describes himself as an amateur historian who likes to collect antique items from that time period. He bought the application about six years ago in Indiana.  The former police officer did not remove the item from the wall because he forgot it was in his antique collection room. He said if Robert and Reyna Mathis had contacted him, he would have explained why he had those items and apologized.  Anderson adamantly denied he is a part of the KKK and pointed out that as a Catholic, he would be considered ""a target"" of the hate group.  Mathis is a U.S. Army veteran who was born in Detroit. He said in a news interview with MLive that Reyna is a native of Muskegon, Michigan.  In the report, Mathis said he toured the home because he and Reyna were looking for a residence that had a significant amount of land so the two of them, along with their 12-year-old daughter and 21-year-old son, could spend more time outdoors.  Mathis, who is black, said he became displeased when he saw the Confederate flags, and the KKK application was a deal-breaker for making an offer on the house.  ""I was like 'Oh my god! This is, this is, oh, I’m getting out of here,' "" he said.  Mathis was disturbed not only by the flag but also because Anderson was a police officer.  ""If he had just been anybody else,"" he said, ""I would’ve just told my wife, you know, let’s put an offer in on the house."" When asked if he contacted one of the owners, Mathis said he did not. He said he's had run-ins with police and might have been arrested by Anderson.  Prosecutors: US Army soldier planned to kill 'antifa' activists, bomb a major news network The report confirmed that the officer had six encounters with Robert and Reyna Mathis, dating to July 2008. In the first case, Robert was pulled over by Anderson for speeding, while Reyna was in the passenger seat. They both exited the vehicle and refused the officer's orders. Anderson placed Reyna under arrest for refusing to follow his orders, and she struck him in the face and eye with her hand, causing minor injury. Robert was issued a citation and released from the scene. Reyna was jailed for obstruction and assault on an officer. She was sentenced to 60 days and $414 in fines.  In October 2008, Reyna Mathis was involved in a bar fight and accused of assaulting another person. She was found to be intoxicated and was arrested by Anderson for two Fail to Appear bench warrants. Reyna went to jail for the incident.  During Anderson's 22-year career as a police officer, he had two complaints made against him. A complaint in 2010 alleged that he acted ""rudely and disrespectfully"" when he arrested two people and used pepper spray. In 2016, a complaint stated that the officer did not give back a driver's license to an arrestee and that he did not secure a vehicle after the arrest.  According to WZZM-TV, the report gave Peterson enough reason to fire Anderson this month. The station reported that since posting the KKK application on Facebook, Robert and Reyna Mathis have received death threats.

Shaped like a phoenix - though to some observers it is more reminiscent of a starfish - the airport was designed by famed Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid.

It was hailed as ""a new powerful source of national development"" at a ceremony overseen by President Xi Jinping, just days ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. A China Southern Airlines Airbus A380 flight to Guangzhou in the country's south was the first to fly out. China is forecast to overtake the United States as the world's largest aviation market by 2022. Daxing, located south of Beijing, will help ease pressure on Capital International Airport in the city's northeast, where capacity constraints often cause flight delays. The new airport is, however, about 46 km (29 miles) away from central Beijing, almost twice the distance of Capital airport. An express train from Daxing will take about 20 minutes to reach the south of Beijing. Daxing will also accommodate passengers from the neighbouring areas of Hebei and Tianjin, linked by a sprawling network of trains, subways and public buses.  China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines will be the main domestic carriers at Daxing. About 50 foreign airlines, including British Airways and Finnair, plan to move all or part of their operations in the next few quarters. The relocation of all airlines is to due to be completed by the winter of 2021. With the opening of Daxing, Beijing Nanyuan Airport, China's oldest airport, will cease operations from Thursday.

47,meet-f-4-phantom-60-045400600.html,Meet the F-4 Phantom: This 60-Year-Old Fighter Jet Wont Stop for Anyone,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 00:54:00 -0400",The story of the legendary F-4 Phantom II.,https://news.yahoo.com/meet-f-4-phantom-60-045400600.html,"You May Also Like: 5 Best Submarines of All Time, 5 Best Aircraft Carriers of All Time, 5 Best Battleships of All Time and Worst Submarine of All Time.  Key point: The F-4 served for a long time and even now serve as target practice drones. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is a legendary aircraft — an icon of the Vietnam War and the archetype of the third-generation jet fighter designs that entered service in the 1960s. More than 5,000 of these heavy supersonic fighters were built, and hundreds continue to serve and even see combat in several air forces today. But the Phantom’s record in air-to-air combat over Vietnam — especially when compared to its successor, the F-15 Eagle, which has never been shot down in air-to-air combat — has left it with a reputation of being a clumsy bruiser reliant on brute engine power and obsolete weapons technology. This is unfair. The Phantom’s fundamental flaws were corrected by 1970 — while more recently, Phantoms have had their avionics and ordnance upgraded to modern standards. These modernized Phantoms flown by the Turkish and Greek air forces can do pretty much what an F-15 can do … at a much lower price. Baptism of Fire: When the F-4 came out it in 1958 it was a revolutionary design — one that went on to set several aviation records. Weighing in at 30,000 pounds unloaded, its enormous J79 twin engines gave (and still gives) the aircraft excellent thrust, propelling the heavy airframe over twice the speed of sound at a maximum speed of 1,473 miles per hour. The early Phantoms could carry 18,000 pounds of munitions — three times what the huge B-17 bombers of World War II typically carried. The weapons officer in the rear-seat could operate the plane’s advanced radar, communication and weapons systems while the pilot focused on flying. Furthermore, the F-4 came in both ground- and carrier-based models and served in the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. The only other frontline fighter to serve in all three services before or since is the F-35. (Recommended: How to Replace the F-35)  But when the F-4 confronted the lighter-weight MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters of the North Vietnamese air force in 1965, the Phantom suffered. In the Korean War, the U.S. Air Force had shot down between six and 10 enemy fighters for every one of its aircraft lost in air-to-air combat. In Vietnam, the ratio was closer to two to one (including other aircraft types besides the Phantom). The F-4’s primary problem was that it had no built-in cannon. Instead, it relied entirely on newly-introduced air-to-air missiles — the radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow, the heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder and the older AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force didn’t realize those early missiles were terrible. Studies showed that 45 percent of Vietnam-era AIM-7s and 37 percent of AIM-9s failed to either launch or lock on, and after evasive maneuvers, the probability of achieving a kill fell to eight percent and 15 percent for the two types, respectively. The Falcon missiles were even worse, and the Pentagon later withdrew them from service. Also From TNI: Donald Trump: The Worst President Ever?  Also From TNI: Donald Trump: Best President Ever?  Also From TNI: Why Japan Really Lost Pearl Harbor  The North Vietnamese MiGs, equipped with both cannons and missiles (on the MiG-21), would outmaneuver the heavier F-4, which for all its speed, was not especially agile. Worse, American pilots weren’t trained for close range dogfights, as the Air Force assumed air-to-air engagements would occur at long range with missiles. Furthermore, the Phantom’s J79 engines produced thick black smoke, which combined with the aircraft’s larger size, made it easier to spot and target from a distance. On the other hand, the rules-of-engagement over Vietnam prohibited U.S. pilots from shooting at unidentified targets beyond visual range, further crippling the advantages of the missiles. Improvements: However, the F-4’s problems began to recede. Air-to-air missile technology dramatically improved with later versions of the Sparrow and Sidewinder. The F-4E model finally came with an internal M161 Vulcan cannon. Before, some Phantom units made do with external gun pods that vibrated excessively. In 1972, an F-4 piloted by Maj. Phil Handley shot down a MiG-19 with his plane’s gun — the only recorded aerial gun kill performed at supersonic speed. Eventually, the Air Force upgraded all of its F-4Es with wing-slats that significantly improved maneuverability at a slight cost in speed. New J79 engines even dealt with the problem of the F-4’s visible black smoke. (Recommended: 5 Greatest Fighter Planes of All-Time) The Navy, in contrast, perceived the problem as being a lack of Air Combat Maneuvering training, and instituted the Top Gun training program in 1968. Navy pilots went on to score a superior kill ratio over Vietnam of 40 victories for seven planes lost in air-to-air combat. The Air Force’s Phantoms claimed 107 air-to-air kills for 33 lost to MiGs, and the Marine Corps claimed three. Ground fire shot down 474 Phantoms in all services, as the heavy-lifting Phantom fighters did double duty as ground-attack aircraft. Two sub-variants of the Phantom also distinguished themselves — the RF-4 photo reconnaissance plane, optimized for speed, and the Wild Weasel, specialized in attacking enemy surface-to-air missiles defenses. The last American F-4s would see action during Operation Desert Storm, before being retired in 1996. The Pentagon later converted some into QF-4 target practice drones. (Recommended: How to Win a War with China) Phantoms in the Middle East: However, the Phantoms proliferated around the world. The F-4 saw extensive use in Israeli service, scoring 116 air-to-air kills against the Egyptian and Syrian air forces, starting in 1969 during the War of Attrition. In one engagement on the first day of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, 28 Egyptian MiGs attacked Ofir Air Base. Just two Phantoms managed to scramble in defense, but they shot down seven of the attackers. The Israeli Phantoms’ primary target — and most deadly foe — during these campaigns were Arab surface-to-air missile batteries. SAMs accounted for most of the 36 Israeli Phantoms lost in action. The swan song of the Israeli Phantom force came during Israel’s 1982 intervention in the War in Lebanon, when Phantoms — escorted by new F-15s and F-16s — wiped out all 30 of Syria’s SAM batteries in the Bekaa Valley in one day without losing a single plane in Operation Mole Cricket 19. Iran received 225 F-4s from the United States prior to the Iranian Revolution. These formed the backbone of the Iranian fighter force during the nine-year-long war with Iraq. The Phantom reportedly acquitted itself well versus Iraqi MiGs, and carried out several long-range raids on the Iraqi airfields. The actual number of air-to-air kills remains disputed. 21st century Phantoms: The Phantom still sees service. But it’s somewhat of an anomaly. Just compare it to F-15 Eagle. The F-15, which entered service in 1975, is emblematic of fourth-generation fighter aircraft that remain the mainstay of modern air forces today. The F-15 is also deliberately unlike the F-4. It’s a heavy, twin-engine, two-seat fighterand an agile dogfighter. When the F-15 and the lighter F-16 saw their first major air action over Lebanon in 1982, they shot down more than 80 Syrian third-generation MiGs at no loss. The supremacy of the fourth-generation was confirmed again in the Gulf War, in which Iraqi fighters shot down only one fourth-generation fighter (an F/A-18 Hornet) for the loss of 33 of their third-generation aircraft. How could the F-4 possibly keep up in this new environment? Easy — by integrating the same modern hardware used in the fourth generation. The Phantoms flown by the Turkish and Greek air forces both have modern pulse-doppler radars, which give the F-4 “look down-shoot down” capabilities. In the past, high-flying radars had trouble detecting low-flying aircraft because the radar waves bouncing off the ground created a cluttering effect. Active Doppler radars cut through the ground clutter. Modern F-4s can also fire the full range of modern ordnance such as the advanced AIM-120C AMRAAM air-to-air missile with a range of 65 miles, precision-guided munitions such as the AGM-65 Maverick, and late model Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles. As combat aircraft are essentially weapons platforms, these capabilities mean that the F-4s can handle most of the same offensive tasks a fourth-generation F-15 or Su-27 fighter can do. But surely the electronics and instruments are out of date? Not really. For instance, modernized F-4s have improved Heads Up Displays (HUDs) so that pilots don’t have to look down from the canopy to check on their instruments. Germany flew upgraded F-4Fs until 2013, and maintains them in stock in case of future need. South Korea still has 71 F-4Es (only modestly upgraded) in its 17th Fighter Wing. Japan maintains the same number of F-4EJ Kais upgraded with pulse-Doppler radars and anti-ship missiles. The Israelis pioneered the art of Phantom upgrades in the 1980s with the Phantom 2000 Kurnass, or “Sledgehammer.” Though retired from Israeli service in 2004, Israeli firms went on to upgrade Greece’s 41 Peace Icarus Phantoms, equipping them with ANPG-65 pulse-Doppler radars and the ability to fire AMRAAM missiles. Israeli upgrades contributed to the Turkish air force’s Terminator 2020, which has additional wing strakes for improved maneuverability. The 2020s have had 20 kilometers of wiring replaced for a net loss of 1,600 pounds in weight. The Turkish versions also feature a diverse array of modern sensors and electronics. Like other modern F-4s, they can deploy advanced ordnance such as Paveway bombs, HARM anti-radar missiles and 3,000-pound Popeye missiles with a range of 48 miles. The Terminators are primarily ground-attack planes … with some notoriety. They’ve bombed Kurdish PKK fighters in Turkey and Iraq in 2015 and 2016. An RF-4 reconnaissance plane was shot down over Syria in 2012, and three F-4s crashed in 2015 — earning them the appellation “Flying Coffins” in the Turkish media. The Iranian air force in 2009 claimed to operate 76 F-4Ds and Es, and six RF-4s. Tehran has reportedly modified the planes to fire Russian or Chinese air-to-ground and anti-shipping missiles. They still rely on AIM-7 Sparrows acquired second hand. Likewise, Iran relies on smuggled and improvised spare parts for its F-4s, just like its F-14 Tomcats. Iranian Phantoms bombed Islamic State targets in Iraq’s Diyala province in December 2014, and they continue to play cat and mouse games with U.S. patrols and drones over the Persian Gulf. But are souped-up F-4s really equal to fourth-generation fighters? None of these 21st century Phantoms have flown in air-to-air combat — but F-4s Phantoms have engaged in non-lethal dogfights with Greek F-16s on several occasions. They also tangled with Chinese Su-27s in a 2010 exercise — and according to some reports on the internet won zero to eight. And if you compare videos of F-4s with wing slats making a tight, 180 degree turn (see 4:25 above) compared to F-15s doing the same maneuver, you will note that they both average seven to eight seconds to complete the turn, even though the latter is purportedly more maneuverable. This doesn’t prove upgraded F-4s are superior to later designs, of course — but it does show they capable of pulling their considerable weight when compared with fourth-generation fighters. The Phantom has proven both versatile and adaptable over time. Few of those present for its first flight in 1958 could have imagined that it would remain in frontline service nearly 60 years later.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, Western Watersheds Project said the Interior Department is unlawfully withholding information from the public about a grazing initiative announced in 2017. ""This is the latest example of the (Trump) administration favoring industrial agriculture over conservation, biodiversity, and wildlife,"" said Scott Lake, Idaho Director of Western Watersheds Project. The group is asking a federal judge to force the government to release information about the program in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado. The environmental group said the program puts private ranchers in charge of grazing on public lands without regard for wildlife such as struggling sage grouse and endangered salmon. The U.S. Justice Department, which defends agencies in lawsuits, didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the suit Wednesday from The Associated Press. In announcing the program, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said it would provide grazing permit holders an unprecedented level of flexibility while also protecting public lands. The Interior Department plan involves lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The plan sites ""Outcome-Based Grazing Authorizations,"" which it said would ""emphasize conservation performance, ecological outcomes and cooperative management of public lands that will also provide greater opportunity for an operator to manage ranching operations that are both economically and environmentally sustainable."" Western Watersheds Project filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out how the plan was working. But the group said in its lawsuit that the Bureau of Land Management didn't make a final determination about the request and the Interior Department never made a decision about the group's appeal seeking the information. The group said those lack of responses and missed deadlines are violations of the Freedom of Information Act. The Bureau of Land Management manages livestock grazing, mostly cattle and sheep, on 240,000 square miles (620,000 square kilometers) of public lands, mainly in the U.S. West. That involves about 18,000 permits and leases on more than 21,000 grazing allotments. The 10-year permits and leases can be renewed if the agency determines conditions of the permit or lease are being met. Those conditions include such things as the health of the rangeland. The Outcome-Based Grazing Authorizations, the Bureau of Land Management said on its website, is an effort to allow livestock grazers to better respond to such things as drought and wildfire. But Western Watersheds Project contends the plan increases livestock grazing with little regard for environmental consequences."

Photos show its journey.","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 11:14:00 -0400","Environmentalists have criticized the concept of floating nuclear plants, arguing that they could be harder to reach during an accident.",https://news.yahoo.com/worlds-first-floating-nuclear-power-151400089.html,"Alexander Ryumin/TASS/Getty Images  As the Akademik Lomonosov sailed across the Arctic Ocean toward a remote region of Russia earlier this month, its freshly-painted exterior bore the signature red, white, and blue colors of the nation's flag.  The vessel is the world's first floating nuclear power plant, complete with two loaded nuclear reactors. It reached the port of Pevek, an Arctic town across from Alaska, on September 14. From there, it will start generating enough electricity for an estimated 100,000 homes. The plant could spur other nations to acquire floating nuclear power plants of their own, but environmentalists worry about the safety of such facilities. Under extreme circumstances, some activists have said, an environmental disaster such as a tsunami could trigger a nuclear explosion at sea. Nuclear experts at the environmental nonprofit Greenpeace have dubbed the floating plant ""Chernobyl on ice,"" a reference to the 1986 nuclear disaster that led to widespread contamination across Europe. Take a look at how the world's first floating nuclear power plant came to life. Peter Kovalev/TASS/Getty Images The plant was named after Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov. It's more than 450 feet long and 30 feet tall.   Lev Fedoseyev/TASS/Getty Images After the Severodvinsk shipyard became overwhelmed with other work orders, the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg was the next logical choice for Rosatom, Russia's state-owned nuclear-energy company, since Soviet nuclear-powered ships were previously manufactured there.   Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images The two reactors produce steam for a turbine that generates electricity. The plant requires a crew of around 70 people.  Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images The station needs to be loaded with fuel every three years. Since it won't have easy access to a nuclear-waste storage facility, plans call for the plant to keep spent fuel onboard for up to 12 years. The reactors are designed to last for 40 years.   Dmitri Lovetsky/AP Photo Nuclear plants have faced heavy scrutiny since the Chernobyl accident in 1986 forced the evacuation of an entire city and caused widespread contamination across Europe. In 2018, Jan Haverkamp, a nuclear-energy expert at the environmental nonprofit Greenpeace,  published a blog post that referred to the floating plant as ""Chernobyl on ice.""  ""You cannot compare the force that came out of Chernobyl with what could come out here, but what you can compare is the attitude that was shown during the construction of this floating nuclear power station,"" he told Business Insider. ""Rosatom has done its very best to keep independent oversight at arm's length during the entire construction phase. That is a recipe for catastrophe.""  Alexander Ryumin/TASS/Getty Images Pevek, Russia's northernmost town, is separated from Alaska by the Bering Strait. Anchorage, Alaska, is about 1,250 miles away.   Alexander Ryumin/TASS/Getty Images A fleet of tugboats carried the vessel to Pevek.  Lev Fedoseyev/TASS/Getty Images Haverkamp's biggest concern about the floating plant was the lengthy trek to Pevek, which he said was ""potentially hazardous"" due to the rocky coastline that borders the Arctic Ocean. If Akademik Lomonosov had crashed into coastal rocks, Haverkamp said, its fuel could have melted and triggered an explosion once it hit the water.  Alexander Ryumin/TASS/Getty Images The floating power plant will replace a coal-fired power plant and an old nuclear plant that are currently servicing the area.   Lev Fedoseyev/TASS/Getty Images China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Algeria, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Argentina have all reportedly expressed interest in acquiring their own floating nuclear plants.   Lev Fedoseyev/TASS/Getty Images In a 2018 report, the International Atomic Energy Agency wrote that ""many countries intend to introduce nuclear power"" or expand their existing nuclear programs in an effort to address climate change.   Lev Fedoseyev/TASS/Getty Images Nuclear plants release more energy using less fuel, so fuel costs are lower. The World Nuclear Association estimates that the fuel costs of a nuclear power plant are about a third to a half of the costs of a coal-fired plant.  Alexander Ryumin/TASS/Getty Images Haverkamp added that it could take longer than a day for emergency-response teams to reach the barge in the event of a disaster. Environments also worry that the presence of spent nuclear fuel onboard could raise the risk of damage if a meltdown were to occur. But Akademik Lomonosov's deputy director recently told CNN that the station has a backup system that can cool the reactors without electricity for 24 hours if an accident happens.   "
