0,"The anonymous whistleblower has tentatively agreed to meet with lawmakers so long as they get appropriate security clearances for legal counsel, attorneys say","Thu, 26 Sep 2019 01:17:26 GMT","The anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, which includes allegations about President Donald Trump's conduct, has tentatively agreed to meet with congressional lawmakers, according to correspondence obtained by CNN",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ez6cwP9mybk/index.html,"The meeting could take place on the condition that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the individual's legal counsel so that they can accompany their client, the correspondence showed. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff wrote a letter to Maguire making the request Wednesday after the whistleblower's lawyers agreed to meet with lawmakers if that condition is met and requested assistance in expediting approval from the acting DNI.  CNN reported Tuesday that the whistleblower's legal counsel ""wrote to the Acting Director of National Intelligence to request specific guidance as to the appropriate security practices to permit a meeting, if needed, with the Members of the Intelligence Oversight Committees."" ""This is a reasonable request that the Committee strongly supports and expects your office to fulfill immediately,"" Schiff wrote. Schiff's letter comes after the whistleblower's legal counsel wrote to the committee Wednesday reiterating the conditions of a possible meeting between lawmakers and their client. ""We have reaffirmed our client's request for direction by correspondence to Acting Director Maguire, a copy of which is included as an enclosure. Furthermore, we have requested for the Acting Director to process and grant myself, I. Charles McCullough, III, and Mark S. Zaid the appropriate security clearances so that legal counsel may be in attendance at any meetings with our client. I am sure you can understand that it is imperative that a whistleblower, especially one caught up in such a high profile matter involving the President, have experienced legal counsel by their side. Your cooperation in ensuring this occurs would help facilitate a future meeting or testimony,"" the letter said. The whistleblower will not appear before lawmakers on Thursday, nor are they currently scheduled to appear before Congress, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.  The source said that the process is underway to ensure the lawyers have access, if needed, to the relevant classified information. Lawmakers have not been told the identity of the whistleblower or where the complainant works in the government. The whistleblower's complaint -- which was hand-delivered to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for lawmakers to review -- deals, at least in part, with a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. A transcript of the conversation released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. Trump has downplayed the significance of the complaint, claiming the whistleblower is partisan and his conversations with foreign leaders have been ""appropriate."" Speaking to CNN Wednesday, Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, said the whistleblower complaint points to ""further evidence to seek"" including ""other witnesses to find, and documents as well as witnesses who would corroborate what he or she is complaining is an urgent and credible concern."" Swalwell described the complaint as a ""five-alarm concern,"" echoing strong rhetoric from other Democratic lawmakers who viewed the document Wednesday. While most lawmakers declined to comment on the complaint Wednesday, some Republicans did push back on the way Democrats were framing the document. Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah told CNN after viewing the complaint that he has ""no concerns"" and that  ""there's nothing in there that changes the way I felt"" earlier in the day when he had expressed support for Trump's accounting of events. Schiff's letter to Maguire comes the same day the acting DNI director rebuked a Washington Post report stating that he threatened to resign if the White House tried to restrict his testimony before Congress. ""I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now,"" he said of the report. ""I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation."" This story has been updated."
1,Trump stays defiant: 'I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo',,,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/5PER4D-lvLw/index.html,"Sitting in a Manhattan hotel meeting room, the men eagerly sought to deflect questions of wrongdoing after a White House transcript released earlier in the day showed Trump pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. The call has formed the basis for Democrats' impeachment probe, and has thrown Trump's presidency into turmoil. But as camera shutters whirred, Trump and Zelensky insisted nothing was untoward.  ""There was no pressure,"" Trump insisted, denying allegations he was using his position of power to prod Ukraine into investigating a political rival. ""Nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky chimed in, denying he felt coerced by Trump to launch a probe. Instead, he suggested he was an unwilling participant in an American political firestorm. ""I'm sorry but I don't want to be involved (in) democratic open elections of USA,"" he said after consulting with a translator. It may be too late for that. The controversy over Trump's dealings with Zelensky have massed into a political and diplomatic watershed, with Ukraine squarely in the center. Trump remained defiant during a rambling Wednesday afternoon news conference that he ""didn't threaten anybody.""  ""No push, no pressure, no nothing,"" Trump said. ""It's all a hoax, folks.""  Trump added, ""I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo. But there was with Biden and there was with the senators."" He said he's told House Republicans he wants ""full transparency on the so-called whistleblower information,"" but continued to peddle conspiracy theories about Biden and his son. He also challenged the credibility of the whistleblower's claims. Trump claimed the individual -- who has not been identified -- ""didn't have any first-class or first-rate or second-tier information from what I understand."" The President told reporters he's willing to release a transcript of another, earlier call with Zelensky, as well as any calls between Ukraine and Vice President Mike Pence.  ""I'll release that, too, if that's important to you,"" Trump said of a call which preceded the July 25 conversation the public learned more about today through a newly released transcript. ""I spoke to him previous to the call that we released."" The mid-afternoon meeting between Trump and Zelensky was arranged well before the whistleblower controversy exploded into public view, according to people familiar with the plans. Aides initially did not view it as a major highlight of Trump's agenda at this week's United Nations meetings, which they expected would focus heavily on Iran and not on the questions of abuse of power. When news emerged that an intelligence whistleblower had filed a complaint related to Trump and Ukraine -- and later that it was related to Trump's July phone call with Zelensky -- White House officials began to view the meeting as an important venue for Trump to counter Democratic accusations of wrongdoing. Trump began by making light of the matter, telling reporters that Zelensky ""made me more famous and I've made him more famous."" And later his attention seemed to drift, recalling his onetime ownership of the Miss Universe pageant, won once by a Ukrainian contestant. But the mood turned grave as Zelensky -- himself a former television personality whose entry into politics was as unlikely as Trump's -- raised Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""If you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration. Not during the Trump administration,"" Trump insisted, ascribing the invasion to his predecessor Barack Obama. Asked whether he wants Zelensky to do more to investigate Biden, Trump said, ""No, I want him to do whatever he can."" The evening before the meeting, Trump and Zelensky greeted each other at a diplomatic reception hosted by the American President for fellow leaders visiting New York for the annual United Nations meetings. A photo posted by Zelensky on Twitter showed the two men with their spouses smiling broadly, without a hint of the controversy that now overhangs their relationship. There have been conversations between US and Ukrainian officials this week about the matter, including over whether to release the log of the July phone call. One official said there had not been extensive conversations between US and Ukrainian officials about what each leader would say during the open-press part of Wednesday's meeting, though they could not rule out more informal discussions, namely between Trump and Zelensky during the diplomatic reception or between Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his Ukrainian interlocutors. Speaking during the meeting, Trump praised Giuliani, his private attorney, for pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, saying he was demonstrating admirable verve. ""Rudy Giuliani is a great lawyer, he was a great mayor, he's highly respected. I've watched the passion he's had on television over the last few days. Incredible what he's done,"" Trump said. The sit-down between Trump and Zelensky on Wednesday was not originally meant to be their first meeting. Trump had agreed to meet Zelensky earlier this month in Poland, where he was planning to commemorate the anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. When a hurricane forced him to cancel his plans, Mike Pence went in his place and met with Zelensky in Warsaw. Afterward, Pence was asked whether the Biden matter arose in the talks. He said no, but did turn quickly to the issue of corruption in Ukraine. Trump and Zelensky have spoken by phone twice: once immediately following Ukrainian elections in April, and again in July. The latter conversation has become the focal point for Democrats after an intelligence whistleblower raised concerns about Ukraine and Russia. In the months following Zelensky's election, Trump showed little interest in meeting him, believing Ukraine to be an intractably corrupt country. He ascribed Russia's annexation of part of the country to his predecessor, who he repeatedly blamed for ""losing"" Crimea. But as Giuliani began raising the issue of Biden and his son, Trump's interest was piqued. He was also convinced by top national security aides, including then-national security adviser John Bolton, that engaging the new leader would be valuable in countering Russia. Bolton was also among those aides pushing Trump to approve an aid package worth millions of dollars to Ukraine after it was put on hold. That package -- and whether it was used as a bargaining chip in Trump's attempts to push an investigation into the Bidens -- has become a lynchpin in the impeachment inquiry."

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President.

4,Washington Post: Acting spy chief threatened to resign if White House restricted his testimony,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 21:28:07 GMT","Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire threatened to resign if the White House tried to restrict his testimony before Congress, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/TKHLvcc__60/index.html,"Citing current and former US officials familiar with the matter, the report came the day before Maguire's highly anticipated congressional testimony about a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General. A source familiar with the situation previously told CNN that the complaint included a July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During that call, Trump pushed for an investigation into potential 2020 political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, a White House transcript shows. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cited the whistleblower's complaint in her announcement of formal impeachment proceedings Tuesday. The officials told the Post that Maguire informed the White House that he would not omit information from his upcoming testimony. The paper reported that the stance was partially meant to push the White House to formally decide whether to assert executive privilege regarding the complaint --- such that Maguire effectively indicated that he would cooperate with Congress unless the White House legally blocked him from doing so, the officials told the Post  Maguire denied the report on Wednesday, asserting in a statement that ""at no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019.""  ""I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now,"" he added. ""I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation."" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham also slammed the report, tweeting that it was ""actually not true."" Maguire has previously lamented to White House staff, such as White House counsel Pat Cipollone, that the White House's strategy to have him deny information to Congress related to a matter is outside his authority, the Post reported. Officials told the paper that Maguire looked to the testimony as a chance to defend his decisions and intentions."

6,Analysis: Bill Barr is at the center Trump's controversy -- again,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:57:57 GMT","When Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into debunked allegations of unethical behavior regarding former Vice President Joe Biden in the country, he suggested his counterpart work with someone in his administration to get to the bottom of it. That man? Attorney General William Barr.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/S1nVmHPQoI4/index.html,"""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,"" Trump told Zelensky on the call, according to a rough transcript released by the White House. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.) On two more occasions during that conversation, Trump said he would have Barr (in addition to Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani) get in touch with Zelensky to look into the Biden thing.  Which is problematic, given that Trump is seemingly putting America's attorney general in charge of coordinating an investigation -- with a foreign power! -- into a possible 2020 rival. Knowing what that looks like, the Justice Department released a statement in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday's transcript release, denying that Barr had any contact with the Ukrainians. ""The Attorney General was first notified of the President's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral,"" said Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec. ""The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son."" Which, well OK.  What's most striking to me about this whole Ukrainian episode is how -- again -- Barr is somehow in the middle of it. It's the latest in a pattern of behavior by Trump -- and Barr -- that always seems to put the attorney general right at the center of the biggest controversies within the administration. (All of which is all the more remarkable when you consider that Barr has only been at the head of the Justice Department since February.) Consider: *Barr's summary of the Mueller report downplayed, in the eyes of many people (including former special counsel Robert Mueller), the seriousness of the documented episodes of obstructive behavior by Trump. *Barr -- in consultation with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- decided not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice after receiving Mueller's report. *Barr is leading the investigation into the actions of the Justice Department -- including then-FBI Director James Comey -- in advance of the 2016 election. *Barr refused to turn over the full, unredacted Mueller report -- for which Democrats held him in contempt. There are just a lot of roads that lead back to Barr. A LOT. That doesn't mean, of course, that Barr has done anything unethical or wrong. What it does mean, though, is that a) the Justice Department -- under his leadership -- is involved in a large number of things that Trump cares deeply about and b) Trump likes and trusts Barr, and likes to have him around or consult him on a wide variety of issues.   Barr is sort of like Trump's security blanket -- when he sees the AG involved, the President just feels better. Which speaks to how Barr -- in a very short period of time -- has become absolutely essential to Trump and the biggest (and highest-profile) fights of his administration. Everywhere there's controversy for Trump, Barr is there too. He's at the center of history, whether he means to be or not."

8,Opinion: 4 reasons conservatives should back impeaching Trump,,"​When the euphoria from the announcement that the US House will pursue an impeachment inquiry of President Trump wears off for Democrats and others who oppose Trump's administration, and all the talking heads have spoken, remember this -- it's important: Trump didn't change the country; he revealed it.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/WKOGgxWzM70/index.html,"This kind of stunning evidence of the President abusing his power is the reason that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally took the major step of throwing her full support behind the impeachment inquiry. The six committees currently investigating President Trump are now operating under one umbrella with the official mandate of determining whether to vote for articles of impeachment. Should they end up taking this vote, Trump would join a small list that includes only three other presidents who have faced impeachment since the establishment of the country (Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and William J. Clinton).  The President has struck back in predictable fashion. ""A total Witch Hunt!"" and ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"" were some of the first words to come in over the Twitter transom. A number of Republicans have already joined him.  At the heart of the counterattack is the claim that impeachment is a radical action. The entire process, Republicans will likely continue to say, is being driven by a Democratic party motivated by its left-wing base. Trump will try to defeat Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats as President Clinton prevailed over Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in 1998.  If Democrats want to retain the support of their moderate wing who have joined this cause and desire to stand any chance of winning over Republican support in the House or Senate, they will need to respond to these charges of harassment. Fortunately for Speaker Pelosi, in the case of Trump, supporters of impeachment have a series of cogent arguments to make to convince GOP members of Congress.    While much of the discussion has centered around the Democrats, the spotlight should be on the GOP. They are the party being tested. And there are four reasons why there is a clear conservative case for the impeachment of President Trump.  1. Restraining the power of presidents  Restraining presidential power should be a top priority for conservatives. Few recent presidents have exercised their power with the same level of reckless abandon as the current commander in chief. If Republicans mean what they say about championing limited government, then there really is no justification for the party's decisions since the time of Richard Nixon to continue granting power to the executive branch when their party was in power. Simply put, further empowering the President means growing the role of government. The fact that the President has so much authority, from the ability to send troops into combat without a Congressional declaration of war to using executive measures to achieve policy goals like building a wall, does not square with their agenda.  Unlikely as it may seem, supporting impeachment is an unprecedented opportunity to reverse course on their hypocrisy and re-embody their own ideals. Trump has exposed, more than almost any of his recent predecessors, just how much a president can do if they are willing to ignore basic norms and if they are not scared about the potential response from Congress or the courts. Supporting the impeachment process, and possibly a decision to impeach and convict, could allow Republicans to go on record showing that they still do believe in small government. 2. Protecting national security Protecting national security has also been a central goal of the conservative movement. During the 1980s, for instance, President Ronald Reagan railed against Democrats for being weak on defense as he pushed for higher defense spending and insisted on taking a tough stand with the Soviets. George W. Bush pushed for a proactive militaristic response to terrorist networks as well as states that he claimed threatened American interests. Yet President Trump has not done much to uphold this tradition. His coziness with Vladmir Putin has frustrated intelligence and military officials who understand that Russia has been conducting ongoing efforts to interfere in our electoral system.  The President has handled relations with North Korea in topsy-turvy fashion, doing little to produce an actual nuclear weapons agreement or halt North Korea's weapons production. His efforts to persuade Ukraine, possibly withholding military aid as an incentive to investigate Trump's 2020 rival Joe Biden, have inspired similar fears. All of this prompted seven moderate Democrats who are veterans of the military to publish their Washington Post piece endorsing the impeachment inquiry.  3. Standing up for the rule of law Republicans have also loved to imagine that they are the party of law and order. Ever since Richard Nixon's time in office, they have tried to assure voters that they are the party that can be best trusted to follow the rule of law and to give law enforcement institutions all the support they need. Under the Trump administration, they have so far been sitting passively as a President ran roughshod over all the institutions they have claimed to champion. Throughout his presidency, Trump has peddled mendacity and offered disinformation contradicting solid intelligence data that has been collected on matters like Russia. He has repeatedly acted with disregard for the law, he's been accused of flagrantly obstructing justice while under investigation by Mueller and refused to cooperate fully with congressional oversight.  The current scandal was triggered by the fact that the administration did not share the whistleblower complaint with Congress, as is required by law. The accumulation of evidence that the President does not abide by the rule of law is overwhelming. Republicans can only show Americans they still care about this crucial aspect of our democracy if they cooperate with this investigation.    4. Mike Pence In addition to these three core conservative elements behind the impeachment investigation, Democrats looking to forge bipartisan accord can reiterate that if President Trump were impeached and convicted, he would be replaced by an extraordinarily conservative Republican -- Vice President Mike Pence -- who is arguably even more rightward than the President. So if this really is a left-wing effort to mount a coup, it is poorly conceived. Success would not change the balance of partisan power nor would it in any way moderate the agenda of the White House.    Based on the voluminous evidence that we already have of Trump's wrongdoing, there is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles. In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for.

Bertrum held his hands over his ears and turned to the wall next to his seat.  After a few minutes, Botham's parents and family and friends stood up to leave.  Allison Jean sobbed loudly as she walked out the door. This was the kind of moment she had been dreading and preparing for.  District Judge Tammy Kemp asked for the body camera footage to be played on Wednesday, the third day of the murder trial in Dallas.   The video showed Dallas police performing CPR on Botham on September 6, 2018, moments after off-duty Dallas police officer Amber Guyger shot the 26-year-old accountant in his home. Guyger told police she believed she was entering her apartment, which was one floor below, and encountered a burglar. She is on trial for murder. The footage was played outside the presence of the jury in a discussion about evidentiary matters. It was recorded on the body camera of one of the officers who responded after Guyger called 911. It was played in the courtroom on Tuesday, but Allison Jean, along with Botham's sister, Allisa Findley, 37, and other family members were able to leave before it was shown.  Botham's parents saw the video on Wednesday for the first time, S. Lee Merritt, a family attorney told CNN. The Jeans didn't know the judge was going to ask to see the footage, Merritt said. As Allison and Bertrum Jean were leaving, it appeared that Kemp realized the family had still been in the room. ""I'm so sorry. I didn't give any thought to the alleged victim's family,"" Kemp said.  Last April, Allison Jean heard the 911 call Guyger placed after the shooting and felt an anger that surprised her. She couldn't hear anyone helping Botham as he lay dying his home, Jean told CNN in an interview from St. Lucia, where she lives and raised Botham. In that moment, she realized she wasn't ready for the trial.  Guyger seemed more concerned about her losing her job than about her son, she said. Guyger said she started giving first aid after calling police, an affidavit said. Prosecutors have sought to show she was derelict in her efforts to save Botham.  Ever since hearing the 911 call, Jean had been preparing to endure the trial and face her son's killer. In therapy sessions, she had worked through scenarios she might encounter in court and ways to cope. Starting in August, she dedicated her Saturdays to pray and fast. She said a prayer every 30 minutes.  In the prayer for her family, especially her children, she asked for ""courage to deal with the trial and acceptance of the outcome,"" she told CNN.  On Wednesday, Findley and Botham's brother, Brandt, remained in the courtroom as the footage played.  More than an hour later, the Jeans returned. Bertrum Jean was still wiping his eyes."

13,San Francisco neighbors erect boulders to keep the homeless away,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 02:26:39 GMT","A group of San Francisco neighbors came up with their own solution after they said the city wouldn't help them with the local homeless and drug dealer population, according to CNN affiliate KGO: They put boulders on the sidewalks.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/RU5zPhBfcXM/index.html,"The group has been going to city meetings and filing reports with the city for six months, according to KGO, but they haven't had any luck. After a turf war one night, one of the residents told KGO the neighbors had had enough. ""It got to the point where everybody was just done,"" the person told KGO. ""People had knives and guns and people were out fighting, carrying on and waking up people in the neighborhood."" Asking not to be identified, that resident told KGO a group of neighbors pitched in to buy 24 boulders that are now placed on their sidewalk to discourage the homeless from pitching tents. It's well known that housing costs in the Bay Area are significantly higher than most cities in the United States, and the homeless population in the city is growing fast, according to a recent study by Zillow.  Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump escalated his political fight with California by threatening to have the Environmental Protection Agency pursue action against San Francisco for its homelessness problem. ""It's a terrible situation that's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,"" Trump said aboard Air Force One, according to a pool report. ""And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them a notice very soon."" Through Facebook, the neighbors organized and raised more than $2,000 for the boulders, according to KGO. ""I don't know if it's a long-term solution, but at least in the short term, they seems to be working in keeping the tents off the sidewalk,"" Lisa McEachron, who works in the area, told CNN. Another neighbor who did not want to be identified told CNN they like the boulders. ""They really need to be there,"" the neighbor said. ""They have helped."" Danielle, who said she wasn't comfortable sharing her last name, lives a few blocks away and walks the area daily. She told CNN she thinks the neighbors could have focused their efforts on fighting for housing or on calls to city officials. ""I know the reality of homelessness and moving people from one sidewalk to another doesn't solve it,"" she said. ""It's as if the people who are for them have the attitude, 'We want to be privileged' not to deal with problem."" The City of San Francisco doesn't plan on removing the boulders. In fact, city spokeswoman Rachel Gordon told CNN officials are looking for ways to sanction them so they can remain in place. CNN reached out to San Francisco's Coalition for Homelessness but has not heard back."

15,Army soldier who allegedly discussed bombing news network indicted,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 01:10:12 GMT","A federal grand jury formally indicted Army soldier Jarrett William Smith, who allegedly discussed bomb-making techniques and suggested targeting a news network that sources say is CNN, according to court documents filed Wednesday.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/5Seh25Fq1rc/index.html,"Smith's indictment comes amid a wave of arrests and charges the Justice Department has made, disrupting possible domestic terror plots. Smith, 24, was stationed at Fort Riley in Kansas before his arrest on Saturday. He allegedly discussed with a confidential source to the FBI that ""the headquarters of a major American news network would be a suggested target, utilizing a vehicle bomb,"" an FBI agent wrote in court papers. The complaint goes on to say that, according to an FBI bomb technician consulted by the investigating agent, Smith's instructions on how to make a vehicle bomb would not have resulted in a viable explosive device. According to Wednesday's indictment, Smith faces two counts of distributing explosives information, including ""detailed six-step instructions for constructing an explosive device"" and a recipe for napalm. His attorney has not responded to requests for comment from CNN.   Smith is also accused of communicating a plan to attack a home in Michigan, and threatening to set fire to the home of someone identified by the initials ""D.H."" Smith is scheduled to appear in federal court in Topeka, Kansas, on Thursday for a detention hearing. According to court documents, Smith also mentioned presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, in a chat with an undercover FBI agent on September 20. The undercover agent had told Smith he was looking to target a politician, and Smith responded with ""Outside of Beto?"" and gave the agent instructions on making a bomb or grenade. Smith had discussed as early as 2016 joining a far-right paramilitary group in Ukraine before he became a US Army soldier in 2017. He then bragged in a Facebook chat about being able to build explosives ""in the style of the Afghans,"" the court filings said. Then, about a month ago, Smith started speaking to the FBI's confidential source and an undercover federal agent. He discussed in an online chat group plotting an attack in the US and said he was looking for other ""radicals."" Smith also suggested targeting the leftist group Antifa, cell towers and a local news station, authorities allege. Two days later, authorities say, Smith suggested the bomb plot against the major news network."

It's unclear exactly why the 2014 Tesla Model S 85 wasn't fully charged and lost juice at such an inopportune moment, according to Fremont Police Department's spokesperson, Geneva Bosques.  ""It happens from time to time, especially if an officer returns to the station to take a report and then they never go back out in the street,"" she told CNN. The police officer driving the Tesla was pursuing a suspect who was wanted in connection with a crime in Santa Clara, according to Bosques. After confirming the license plate, the officer attempted a traffic stop, the car failed to yield and the driver took off at a high rate of speed, she said. ""Just realized I am down to six miles of battery on the Tesla, so I may lose it here in a sec,"" the officer driving the Tesla said, according to Fremont Police dispatch audio obtained via Broadcastify. Other police units were following behind to assist and ultimately took over the pursuit with help from California State Highway Patrol, according to Bosques. She said the chase was called off after 10 minutes when it was deemed unsafe because of the way the suspect was driving. California State Highway Patrol later found the suspect's car abandoned in San Jose. Fremont Police said they are still in their 6 months of a pilot program testing the integration of the Tesla with the department and that they are keeping track of all the data. ""We have no written policy regarding gas or charging, but the general guideline is that it should at least be half full at the beginning of the shift, which this car was,"" Bosques said. Bosques said last week's incident doesn't change the way the department feels about the performance of the car for patrol purposes. "

20,10th person dies from rare EEE infection,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 23:33:51 GMT","The Massachusetts Department of Public Health reported on Wednesday there's been a fourth death in the commonwealth from Eastern equine encephalitis, bringing the nationwide total to 10 deaths.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/MebW8pb2Gnk/index.html,"An area hospital notified state officials of the death. The patient lived in Essex County. There have also been three deaths in Michigan, two in Connecticut and one in Rhode Island. Eastern equine encephalitis, known as EEE, is a rare virus transmitted by mosquitoes. There are typically only 5 to 10 human cases reported in the United States each year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 30% of all cases result in death. This year there has been an uptick in the number of reported cases, nearly 30 among several states. Tests also confirmed an 11th human case of the mosquito-borne virus in Massachusetts. The patient is a man in his 70s who lives in Worcester County. With this latest infection, Massachusetts elevated several more communities to high risk. The communities of Auburn, Charlton, Dudley, Leicester, Southbridge and Spencer are now included in the 46 communities considered to be at high risk. There are also 35 communities at critical risk and 122 at moderate risk. EEE virus has been found in 422 mosquito samples in Massachusetts this year, according to the department, many in species that are capable of spreading the virus to humans. The mosquitoes can also infect animals. There is a vaccine for horses who get EEE, but there is no vaccine for humans.  ""Although mosquito populations are declining at this time of year, risk from EEE will continue until the first hard frost,"" said State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Brown. ""We continue to emphasize the need for people to protect themselves from mosquito bites."" Massachusetts has done some aerial spraying to kill mosquitoes, but the state is done for this season. The spraying helps reduce the risk of EEE, but the risk will persist until that first hard frost. The health department encourages people to wear long pants, socks and long sleeves to reduce the amount of skin exposed to the bugs. Use bug spray and limit outdoor activities to an hour before sunset up until dawn. That's when the bugs bite the most."

The 32-year-old took legal action after a registrar told him that UK law required people who give birth to be registered as mothers on birth certificates.   This establishes the first legal definition of the term ""mother"" in English common law. In ruling with the government, Andrew McFarlane, the president of the High Court's family division, deemed that being a ""mother"" referred to being pregnant and giving birth, regardless of whether that person, in law, was a man or a woman. ""There is a material difference between a person's gender and their status as a parent,"" McFarlane ruled.  ""Being a 'mother,' whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth.  ""It is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognized in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. Whilst that person's gender is 'male,' their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of 'mother.'"" McConnell, a multimedia journalist for UK newspaper The Guardian, started taking testosterone aged 25 and a year later had surgery to remove breast tissue. In 2016, he stopped taking testosterone and subsequently his menstrual cycle restarted before he became pregnant using sperm from a donor.  A feature-length film called ""Seahorse,"" documented McConnell's journey.  On Twitter, McConnell said he would appeal. ""I'm saddened by the court's decision not to allow trans men to be recorded as father or parent on their children's birth certificates,"" he wrote.  ""I fear this decision has distressing implications for many kinds of families. I will seek to appeal and give no more interviews at this stage."" In praising McConnell, the judge said the case was an ""important matter of public interest"" and that there was a ""pressing need"" for the UK's legislators to address ""square-on"" the status of a trans male who has become pregnant and given birth to a child.  Existing legislation and UK and European human rights case law, McFarlane said, did not directly engage with the central question.  McFarlane ruled: ""The issue which has most properly and bravely been raised by the claimant in this claim is, at its core, a matter of public policy rather than law. It is an important matter of public interest and a proper cause for public debate.""  In July 2019, McFarlane had removed McConnell's right to anonymity after UK media organizations successfully argued that the publicity surrounding McConnell's film and the public interest in the question of how the state recognized parenthood meant his identity should be known.

25,These three black holes are going to collide,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 23:05:56 GMT","When galaxies collide, so do the supermassive black holes at the center of each galaxy. For the first time, astronomers have observed a triple collision of galaxies, which have sent their black holes on a collision course, according to a new study.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/kKix6Wxy1DM/index.html,"The massive crash is located a billion light-years from Earth in the SDSS J084905.51+111447.2 system. To see it, astronomers needed to use telescopes on the ground and in space. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Telescope in New Mexico imaged the system in optical light. Follow-up by citizen scientists involved in the Galaxy Zoo project helped tag the system as a galactic collision.  More detective work ensued. NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer showed glowing infrared light coming from the collision. The Chandra X-ray Observatory showcased bright points of light at the center of each galaxy. NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array spotted gas and dust. Combined, these revealed active, feeding, supermassive black holes.  Research on the rare triple system was published this week in The Astrophysical Journal. ""We were only looking for pairs of black holes at the time, and yet, through our selection technique, we stumbled upon this amazing system,"" said study author Ryan Pfeifle, a graduate research assistant at George Mason University. ""This is the strongest evidence yet found for such a triple system of actively feeding supermassive black holes."" Such a massive collision sounds like it would appear more obvious. But three supermassive black holes gobbling material in the midst of a giant galactic merger creates a lot of gas and dust that can hide the event from our telescopes.  The images and data captured in different wavelengths of light eventually provided all of the pieces necessary to reconstructing the galactic puzzle.  ""Through the use of these major observatories, we have identified a new way of identifying triple supermassive black holes. Each telescope gives us a different clue about what's going on in these systems,"" Pfeifle said. ""We hope to extend our work to find more triples using the same technique."" Pairs of black holes have been observed before, but not a trio. A pair of black holes will merge into a larger one. Three should merge even quicker. Previously, astronomers have puzzled over the ""final parsec problem,"" where two black holes become close but need another factor to overcome their massive energy and actually merge. A third black hole could be that factor. Another consequence of these merging black holes are gravitational waves, or ripples in space and time.  ""Dual and triple black holes are exceedingly rare,"" said Shobita Satyapal, study co-author at George Mason University. ""But such systems are actually a natural consequence of galaxy mergers, which we think is how galaxies grow and evolve."""

27,Analysis: The British Parliament is back and it's angrier than ever,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:26:33 GMT",The British Parliament has been back in business for less than a day and already the Brexit debate has  reached a new and dizzying level of bizarreness.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/icKtBhRSyLk/index.html,"On Wednesday evening amid ugly scenes in the House of Commons, a combative Boris Johnson took the extraordinary step of daring Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the official opposition, to call a vote of no confidence in the government he leads. Parliament was ""paralyzed,"" the Prime Minister argued. ""This Parliament must either stand aside and let this government get Brexit done, or bring a vote of confidence and finally face the day of reckoning with the voters,"" he said. Corbyn declined Johnson's kind offer. ""I thank the Prime Minister for an advance copy of his statement,"" he told lawmakers. ""Unfortunately, it was like his illegal shutting down of Parliament -- null, of no effect, and should be quashed, in the words of the Supreme Court."" To people looking on from the UK and around the world, it all must have looked completely topsy-turvy.  Johnson says he wants an election, but can't make it happen. The opposition claims it wants an election, but won't make it happen. British politics is in a deeply weird place. The government and the opposition each hold the keys to giving the other what they want, but neither wants to be the one to release the lock. Johnson is leading a minority government and wants an early general election as soon as possible. In order to get one, he needs the country to believe he is fighting tooth and nail to get Brexit over the line, once and for all. Corbyn and the rest of the opposition are frustrating his efforts at every turn. That's the message he is hammering home, over and over. If the polls are to be believed, it's a narrative that's working in his favor.  Labour and the rest of Johnson's opponents, however, only want an election after they can be absolutely sure that the looming October 31 Brexit deadline has been neutered. Only a delay, they argue, would prevent a no-deal Brexit which they believe would cause economic havoc, and even put lives at risk. Doubtless, they are sincere in this argument. However, it's hard to ignore the idea floated in some corners that if Brexit is delayed, Johnson would have failed to deliver his central promise and his poll numbers would collapse. A clearer path to power, therefore, would emerge for Labour and the other UK opposition parties. That's why Corbyn may not bring forward a confidence vote now, but instead continue to pile political pressure on the Prime Minister to resign. If the Labour leader can force that scenario, someone else would be forced to ask Brussels for a Brexit extension and Johnson would be cast as an abject failure who quit when the going got tough. All of which would presumably work to the electoral advantage of one Jeremy Corbyn.  Johnson and Corbyn, it seems, are trying to trick the other into acting against their own interest. The politics of the UK have seldom been this baffling.  It's hard to see that this will lead to anything other than a monumental grudge match. We got a taste of it on Wednesday -- the exchanges in the Commons were among the angriest and most bitter in years.  Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, said Parliament was ""dead"" and ""no moral right"" to sit. Johnson, later, peppered his remarks with the people-versus-parliament rhetoric of ""surrender"" and ""betrayal"" that has become his trademark. In response to calls from Labour MPs to moderate his tone and reflect on the politically motivated murder three years ago of lawmaker Jo Cox, Johnson said: ""The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory is to get Brexit done."" Even some Conservative MPs were aghast that the Prime Minister would use the horror to make a political point. But don't expect him to back down. Johnson thinks it will work, and there will be more to come. Parliament is back -- and angrier than ever. The next few weeks will get even uglier."

But after a second meeting with the two leaders Wednesday ended with no breakthrough, Rivlin acted quickly to get the formal process of coalition building underway. ""The decision to give the mandate [to Netanyahu] was based on the question of who has the better chance of forming a government,"" Rivlin explained. ""Right now, Benjamin Netanyahu's chance of forming a government is higher."" Rivlin urged Netanyahu and all potential coalition allies to reach an agreement, warning, ""The country does not want more elections."" Tough task for Netanyahu It is the second time this year Netanyahu has been asked to form a government. After he failed in April to put together the required 61-seat coalition, he triggered new elections rather than allow any other member of parliament the opportunity to try to form a government. The 69-year-old leader will now have four weeks to form a coalition, with a possible two-week extension if required. His task this time around looks even harder. Following April's election, he had a total of 60 seats with his ultra-Orthodox and religious Zionist partners; now he has just 55 seats. Though Gantz's Blue and White party won one more seat than Netanyahu's Likud party, Gantz was only able to muster the backing of 54 seats in the Knesset, drawn from the center-left parties plus three of the four Arab parties.  Standing next to Netanyahu as he handed over the mandate Wednesday evening, President Rivlin expressed no illusions about the challenge facing the political system, and he implored those politicians who have ruled out sharing power with religious parties or with Arab parties, among others, to drop their objections. ""As long as there are boycotts of whole parts of Israeli society, as long as there is no interest in forming new alliances between large and small parties, as long as there is no real desire to reach an agreement and to compromise, no government can be established,"" Rivlin said. Accepting the task of forming a government, Netanyahu made a fresh appeal to his main opponent: ""We will not be able to put together a government, except together. And that's a unity government. A unity government can be put together quickly."" In response, Gantz issued a statement saying he remained in favour of a broad, liberal unity government, but not under a Prime Minister suspected of criminal activity. ""Blue and White under my leadership does not agree to sit in a government in which its leader faces a severe indictment. This issue, along with other essential issues, is more important to us than the distribution of ministries or a rotation government."""

""This morning we cut the ribbon on the new @GravityPymts Boise office AND announced that all of our employees here will start earning our $70k min salary,"" Price announced on Twitter. ""I'm so grateful to work with this amazing team and to be able to compensate them for the value they bring to our community."" The Boise office was previously an independent company called ChargeItPro, and Gravity, a credit card processing company, acquired it as a subsidiary three years ago. In 2015, Price decided to hike his employees' pay after he read a study about happiness. It said additional income can make a significant difference in a person's emotional well-being up to the point when they earn $75,000 a year. He then made the decision to increase the salaries for all of his 120 employees in Seattle, raising the minimum salary to $70,000 -- and slashing his $1 million salary by 90% in order to make it happen. The move doubled the pay of about 30 of his workers and gave an additional 40 significant raises. Price says the higher wages have transformed the lives of his employees. They have been able to grow their families, more than 10% of employees have purchased a house for the first time and individual 401(k) contributions have more than doubled. Since then, Price has shared his story all over the country and has inspired other business leaders to do the same. "
32,Burnout is a big deal: How managers can spot it,"Mon, 09 Sep 2019 15:06:11 GMT",You've probably been hearing a lot about workplace burnout lately.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/4CTamb7YJKo/index.html,"Earlier this year, burnout was added to the World Health Organization's list of official medical diagnoses. Burnout can occur when we face chronic work stress, explained David Ballard, senior director of the American Psychological Association's Office of Applied Psychology. We are really only equipped to handle stress in short bursts -- so when we face elevated levels of stress at work for a long time, we risk burning out. ""If it's not managed effectively over time, it can affect job performance,"" said Ballard. ""It can leave one feeling exhausted, unmotivated and ineffective on the job. Job performance can also suffer."" Managers and employees both play a role when it comes to identifying and managing burnout.  ""Employees have to take steps to have effective coping skills to manage stress,"" said Ballard. ""Employers can work to create an environment that is conducive to healthy employees: identifying stressors and reducing and eliminating them when they can and making sure they have health and management resources.""  Here are some potential red flags that managers can look for:  First in, last out  There are going to be times when work requires long hours -- but you can only burn the candle at both ends for so long. ""Pushing yourself for a few weeks is okay ... but after a while it becomes really detrimental to your health and ability to do work at the same quality level,"" said Leigh Stringer, author of ""The Healthy Workplace."" Managers need to set the tone when it comes to work-life balance. Don't be afraid to stress the importance of having a life: ask about outside-of-work activities, offer flexible work arrangements to help navigate busy schedules, and exhibit the behavior you want to see.  ""The key is communicating expectations,"" Ballard said. ""If you are in a senior leadership position and are putting in long hours into the evenings and weekends and that fits well for you, make sure you are clear with your employees what is expected of them."" Everything is a priority  Workers who might be struggling with burnout could have a hard time prioritizing tasks.  ""When somebody sees everything as being a really high priority, they don't know what to minimize and they don't know when to stop,"" said Adam Goodman, director of the Center for Leadership at Northwestern University. When giving a new task or project, managers should ask employees what else they have going on to make sure no one's plate is getting too full and to help prioritize assignments.  There's silence  When a typically chatty employee who often participates in meetings and is engaged and enthusiastic suddenly becomes unmotivated and quieter, that person could be at risk for burnout.   ""Their bodies are at work, but their heart and soul are not, and you are noticing a lower participation rate,"" said Stringer. How they describe their work can also be telling.  ""If you ask how a project is going and normally they give you a full lowdown, and instead they're now giving one-word answers ... and seem completely disengaged with it, that is a sign a team member may experience burnout,"" said Ben Fanning, author of ""The Quit Alternative: The Blueprint for Creating the Job You Love Without Quitting."" If you are sensing some distance from an employee, try pulling them aside and asking them to grab coffee or go for a walk. ""Take them outside the throes of work and have an off-site discussion that shows you care about them as a person. Reaching out is very important,"" said Stringer.  A sour apple all the time  Venting in the workplace is common — and sometimes helpful. But when a person becomes overly negative all the time without offering solutions, it could be a sign they are stuck in a rut, according to Fanning.  Also pay attention to any shifts in behavior.  For instance, if an employee is normally very cordial and patient with coworkers or customers, but is now frequently losing patience quickly, that can also be a sign of burnout, Fanning added.  Negative attitudes are contagious and can spread throughout an office and take a toll on productivity and engagement.  Fanning suggested taking a ""set, achieve and celebrate""  tactic in the office. This involves setting clear goals and once they are achieved, celebrating them. ""A lot of managers don't set a clear goal, they just want to achieve,"" he said. And when it comes to celebrating, it doesn't have to be a big office party. ""Recognize the work or person in a team meeting. A little bit of recognition can really help out."" Cognitive Issues We all make mistakes. But when they become repetitive it may signal a problem. ""If they keep making the same mistake frequently and they aren't in the zone, that could be a sign of experiencing burnout,"" said Fanning.  Other red flags are when people start having difficulty with concentration and have a harder time solving problems and issues with memory or making decisions, according to Ballard. ""If someone's is work performance is slipping, it gives you the opportunity as manager to have a conversation and point to resources to help support,"" he said. "

34,What to do when someone interrupts you,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 17:51:16 GMT",You're halfway through making a well-thought-out point in a meeting and then -- all of a sudden -- a colleague jumps in and cuts you off.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/fmyX_h1JdF4/index.html,"What should you do? ""If you allow someone to constantly interrupt you and take over the meeting, you lose your voice,"" said Jay Sullivan, managing partner at Exec-Comm, a business communication skills consulting firm. ""If someone isn't allowed to add value they are diminished, and they don't have a chance to really shine.""  Getting interrupted can leave you feeling flustered and even mad, but there are ways to regain your ground without causing tension. Don't assume ill intent  It's not fun getting interrupted -- it feels disrespectful and can make you lose your train of thought. But the interrupter doesn't always have malicious intentions.  ""For some people, it can be challenging not to interrupt, they can be excited to contribute to the conversation,"" said Stacey Engle, president of Fierce Conversations. But that doesn't mean you should let people walk all over you.  ""If you are constantly being interrupted, that could harm your career pretty quickly,"" said Tania Luna, Co-CEO of LifeLabs Learning, which provides training to companies. ""You won't be seen as an impactful contributor."" That can be especially true in the case of ""mansplaining"" or ""hepeating,"" where male colleagues talk over or interrupt women or repeat their ideas and get the recognition the female colleague otherwise would have deserved.   Know your audience If you find yourself getting cut off, the key is to keep your cool and remain calm.  Sullivan recommended saying the person's name -- but with a positive tone. ""By saying their name, they almost always will immediately stop talking."" Then continue to say how you appreciate the insight or that you are glad they agree with you, but that you want to finish your thought.  ""You've now taken the floor back, but you have not done anything to alienate the room by coming across negative,"" he said.  It can also be helpful to have a couple go-to phrases on the ready if you get interrupted to avoid getting flustered. Luna suggested saying something like: ""Before we move on let me finish my thought"" or ""I was 75% done with my thought."" ""Give them a percentage. That gamifies it a bit; people will be interested in what the 25% was."" If you aren't comfortable repeating the crime, you can wait for the interrupter to finish.  ""Make sure to hold your spot in the conversational queue,"" said Luna. That means making sure you get to finish making your point before the conversation turns to a new topic.  The rules change a little if it's your boss who cuts you off. ""Know the room and your role, why you are in the meeting,"" said Sullivan. ""If it's your manager interrupting, your job is not to try and step in over the manager and regain your voice. You cant publicly challenge the boss in the meeting. That isn't going to work.""  Have a one-on-one conversation later to discuss what happened. You can initiate by saying how you are trying to show more leadership skills in meetings by sharing your thoughts, but didn't get a chance after being interrupted.  Own the conversation If you're giving a presentation, set expectations up front.  To avoid being talked over, Luna recommended clarifying at the start that you will hear questions at the end.  However, if it's the boss or person who asked you to give the presentation that is interrupting, that might mean it's time to ditch your plan and skip to what's being asked about.  ""Your only agenda is to meet their agenda,"" said Sullivan, who added saying something like: I am glad you asked about that let's jump to that part of the presentation, or, I was going to get to that in a few minutes but I am happy to get to that right now.  Help others have a voice  Meeting leaders are not only in charge of setting and executing the agenda, they also need to make sure everyone has a chance to speak freely without getting cut off.  If you notice that someone is getting interrupted, Sullivan suggested explaining that it would be helpful to hear more of what the person was saying.  The key is to emphasize that it will be productive to the team to hear the complete thought.  ""Saying 'I want to hear the rest of Susan's thoughts' makes it about you and your desires,"" explained Sullivan. ""Instead, say: 'I think it would be helpful to the group to hear the rest of Susan's thoughts.'"" Having a few ritual questions that you ask at every meeting can also encourage everyone to feel comfortable speaking up and giving their input, suggested Luna. Questions like: ""Who haven't we heard from yet?"" or ""What point of view haven't we considered?"" can help open the dialogue more and make people more likely to speak up. "
35,"The job market is so good, new hires are ghosting their first day of work","Mon, 16 Sep 2019 13:51:08 GMT","The labor market is going strong, and job candidates have plenty of opportunities to choose from. So much so that some are bailing on their new employers before they even start.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/vf3zJXIJ2Hw/index.html,"""People are getting multiple offers in a market like today, and they are not showing up on their first day of work,"" said Paul McDonald, senior executive director at staffing firm Robert Half.  He pointed to the strong job market and low unemployment rate as the reason for this surge in ghosting by new hires.    Steve Lindner, CEO of employment firm the WorkPlace Group, was ghosted recently by a new hire. The applicant accepted an offer and passed the background check.  ""We had already shared the name with our support team and had a training program in place. Everything was ready to go,"" said Lindner. And then no one showed up.  But at least this candidate called the next day to explain what happened. Another new hire failed to show on the first day 18 months ago and Lindner still has no idea what happened. ""They just never arrived. It was complete job abandonment."" The company called, emailed, texted and eventually had to send a formal letter terminating the employment.  The cost of a no-show   Flaking on the first day of work isn't completely new. The move tends to flare up in hot job markets when job seekers have more power.  Jeremy Tolley, chief people officer at CareHere, said he started noticing more no-shows in 2016. That year, he said a dozen candidates didn't show up for their first day. His company operates health and wellness centers for employers across the country. To combat the problem, the company created a better career website and increased the amount of contact with candidates leading up to their first day to establish more of a relationship. ""We are creating a sense of obligation to this person,"" he said. ""That way it's not just some company they don't know much about, they start to think: 'If I don't show up, I will let them down, I know they are expecting and preparing for me.'"" When a new worker doesn't show up, it means starting the expensive and time-consuming hiring process over. And that also puts pressure on existing employees.  ""The morale effect is very real when someone doesn't show up for the first day of work,"" said McDonald. Employees often feel the toll when a position sits vacant for a long period of time.  It's also not a good look when clients have been told about a new hire who doesn't appear. ""It causes a lot of internal issues. The employer was counting on them and it could be embarrassing if customers and clients were also waiting for the arrival,"" said Lindner.  Deserters beware  The job market is good right now, but it won't always be this way. So it's important to protect your brand and avoid burning bridges.  ""When the job market turns... applicants who ghosted are going to have fewer job opportunities available to them,"" warned Lindner. Companies can take note of who didn't show up for an interview or their first day, and that can come back to haunt you should you apply to the same company again later.  Plus, it's a small world: You never know where you might run into that recruiter or hiring manager that you stood up later in your career. Yes, it might be an uncomfortable conversation to have, but call and let an employer know you won't be joining the team after all.  ""Own your decision,"" said Lindner. ""Most prudent people will understand. I may be disappointed as an employer that you initially accepted my job and are turning me away, but I respect the call.""  Telling an employer you've decided to take another job offer can also open the door to negotiations.  ""We understand the industry we are in and what the market is like,"" said Tolley. ""Sometimes this gives us an opportunity to counter the offer or figure out why you accepted another position. Maybe there is something we can do about that."""
36,Which drink is best for hydration? Hint: It isn't water,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 16:48:19 GMT","When you're thirsty and in need of a drink, which beverages are best at keeping you hydrated?",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/h49dUG5vlTY/index.html,"Sure, you can always reach for a glass of water -- but plain H20 isn't the most hydrating beverage around, according to a study from Scotland's St. Andrews University that compared the hydration responses of several different drinks. The researchers found that while water -- both still and sparkling --does a pretty good job of quickly hydrating the body, beverages with a little bit of sugar, fat or protein do an even better job of keeping us hydrated for  longer.  The reason has to do with how our bodies respond to beverages, according to Ronald Maughan, a professor at St. Andrews' School of Medicine and the study's author. One factor is the volume of a given drink: The more you drink, the faster the drink empties from your stomach and gets absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can dilute the body's fluids and hydrate you.   The other factor affecting how well a beverage hydrates relates to a drink's nutrient composition. For example, milk was found to be even more hydrating than plain water because it contains the sugar lactose, some protein and some fat, all of which help to slow the emptying of fluid from the stomach and keep hydration happening over a longer period of time.   Milk also has sodium, which acts like a sponge and holds onto water in the body and results in less urine produced.   The same can be said for oral rehydration solutions that are used to treat diarrhea. Those contain small amounts of sugar, as well as sodium and potassium, which can also help promote water retention in the body.  ""This study tells us much of what we already knew: Electrolytes -- like sodium and potassium -- contribute to better hydration, while calories in beverages result in slower gastric emptying and therefore slower release of urination,"" said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian, personal trainer and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who was not involved in the study. Sugar in moderation But here's where it gets tricky: Beverages with more concentrated sugars, such as fruit juices or colas, are not necessarily as hydrating as their lower-sugar cousins. They may spend a little more time in the stomach and empty more slowly compared to plain water, but once these beverages enter the small intestine their high concentration of sugars gets diluted during a physiological process called osmosis. This process in effect ""pulls"" water from the body into the small intestine to dilute the sugars these beverages contain. And technically, anything inside the intestine is outside your body.    Juice and soda are not only less hydrating, but offer extra sugars and calories that won't fill us up as much as solid foods, explained Majumdar. If the choice is between soda and water for hydration, go with water every time. After all, our kidneys and liver depend on water to get rid of toxins in our bodies, and water also plays a key role in maintaining skin's elasticity and suppleness. It's the cheapest moisturizer you'll find. While staying hydrated is important -- doing so keeps our joints lubricated, helps prevent infections, and carries nutrients to our cells -- in most situations people don't need to worry too much about how hydrating their beverages are.   ""If you're thirsty, your body will tell you to drink more,"" Maughan said.  But for athletes training seriously in warm conditions with high sweat losses, or for someone whose cognitive function may be negatively impacted by working long hours without beverage breaks, hydration becomes a critical issue.   Can beer and lattes keep me hydrated? Alcohol acts as a diuretic, which causes you to pass more urine, so when it comes to alcoholic beverages hydration will depend on a beverage's total volume. ""Beer would result in less water loss than whiskey, because you are ingesting more fluid with beer,"" Maughan said.  ""Strong alcoholic drinks will dehydrate, dilute alcoholic drinks will not."" When it comes to coffee, how well your java hydrates you will depend on the amount of caffeine you consume.  A regular coffee with about 80 milligrams of caffeine -- roughly what you would find in 12 oz. of Folgers' house blend -- would be pretty much as hydrating as water, according to Maughan's research.   Consuming more than 300mg of caffeine, or about 2-4 cups of coffee, could cause you to lose excess fluid as the caffeine causes a mild, short-term diuretic effect. This is more likely to happen with someone who doesn't typically consume caffeine, and it could be offset by adding a tablespoon or two of milk to your cup of joe."
37,You may want to ditch these drinks to live longer,"Wed, 04 Sep 2019 04:57:00 GMT","Brace yourself, lovers of diet sodas and sugary drinks. It's more bad news and yet another reason to consider ditching your favorite soda or soft drink.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/mK5J2t9t3nU/index.html,"A new study followed more than 450,000 people from 10 European countries for up to 19 years and found those who drank two or more glasses of any type of soda a day had a higher risk of dying from any cause of death than people who drank less than a glass each month. None of the people had cancer, diabetes, heart disease or stroke before their participation. The study, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, found men and women who drank two or more glasses a day of sugar-sweetened soft drinks had a higher risk of dying from digestive disorders, while those who drank the same amount of diet drinks had higher risks of dying from cardiovascular disease.  The link to digestive disease in the study is interesting, said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. ""Experimental evidence suggests that high blood sugar and high sugar intake can impair the gut barrier, leading to a 'leaky gut' and access to the gut immune system causing intestinal inflammation, alter gut microbiota and increase susceptibility to gut infections,"" she said. ""These pathways may increase susceptibility to digestive diseases."" Total soft drink consumption in the study was also associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease, but not with Alzheimer's or cancer. Soft drinks were defined as ""low calorie or diet fizzy soft drinks"", ""fizzy soft drinks,"" such as cola and lemonade, and ""fruit squash or cordials,"" which are non-alcoholic concentrated syrups typically mixed with sugar and water. In this study, one glass of soft drink was 8 fluid ounces, or 250 milliliters; the typical can of soda around the world holds 12 fluid ounces or 355 milliliters. The end of a love affair? This large, long-term study is yet another in a growing list of research that is sounding the alarm on our love affair with carbonated soft drinks.  In February, the American Heart Association released a study that found drinking two or more of any kind of artificially sweetened drinks a day is linked to an increased risk of clot-based strokes, heart attacks and early death in women over 50. The risks were highest for women with no history of heart disease or diabetes and women who were obese or African-American. Previous research has shown a link between diet beverages and stroke, dementia, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes. In March, a study published in the journal Circulation used data from 80,500 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study and nearly 40,000 men from the Health Professionals study. It found that women who drank more than two servings a day of sugary beverages -- defined as a standard glass, bottle or can -- had a 63% increased risk of premature death compared to women who drank them less than once a month. Men who did the same had a 29% increase in risk. Those who consumed more than one sugary beverage per month but fewer than two per day seemed to experience a dose effect: The more they drank, the greater the risk.  Substituting one sugary beverage per day with an artificially sweetened one was found to lower the risk of premature death, but drinking four or more artificially sweetened beverages increased the risk of premature death from cardiovascular disease in women. The same effect was not seen for men, and it was not seen for the risk of dying from cancer. While the studies above didn't see an association between soft drinks and cancer, another study published in the BMJ in July did. The research followed more than 100,000 French adults and found drinking just a small glass of a sugary drink per day -- 100 ml, about a third of a typical can of soda -- to an 18% increase in overall cancer risk and a 22% increase in risk for breast cancer. Only an association This study, as well as other research on the connection between diet and sugary beverages and health risks, is observational and cannot show cause and effect. That's a major limitation, researchers say, as it's impossible to determine whether the association is due to a specific artificial sweetener, a type of beverage, obesity or another hidden health issue. ""The cause behind these associations isn't clear,"" said Bergquist. ""Other potential biological causes could be attributed to experimental evidence linking consumption of artificial sweeteners to sugar cravings, appetite stimulation and glucose intolerance.""  Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council, a trade group for low-calorie and diet foods and beverages, said in a statement that ""low- and no-calorie sweeteners have a long safety record and are important tool for weight management and those managing diabetes. This study paints an inaccurate picture of the important role of these products for consumers."" Surviving a broken heart  Association or not, you've decided to end the fling with your soft drink du jour (and avoid future infidelities). Good for you, literally. Here are  some tips on how to do it with the least heartache. Cut back correctly Going cold turkey is tough and may set you up for failure. Instead, registered dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer suggests a gradual approach. ""Cut back by one serving per day until you're down to one drink per day,"" Drayer said. ""Then aim for one every other day until you can phase out soft drinks entirely. ""Alternate with seltzer/sparkling water can help you cut back,"" she added. ""Eventually you can replace soft drinks with seltzer or sparkling water if you are craving carbonation."" Find a different fizz Speaking of carbonation, for a lot of folks, the fix is the fizz. Find a carbonated seltzer water or mix a healthy fruit alternative with sparkling water. You can't go wrong with blueberry or pomegranate juice, said registered dietitian and nutritionist Rahaf Al Bochi, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  ""The recommendation for fruit juice is usually 4 ounces a day, Al Bochi said. One caution: Try to drink your bubbly with food, not alone, experts advise. Any type of carbonated water can erode the enamel on your teeth. That's because the carbon dioxide that turns water bubbly turns into carbonic acid in the mouth, which can be detrimental to the health of your teeth. Stomp the sweet tooth Bergquist suggests satisfying your sugar cravings by substituting naturally sweet foods such as fruits and dates, which contain ""health-promoting vitamins, minerals and bioactive chemicals called phytonutrients.""  ""They package sugar with fiber which leads to a slow and steady, rather than sharp, rise in blood sugar,"" Bergquist said.  She also suggests committing to a no-sugar challenge for at least two weeks.  ""Our taste buds turn over every two weeks,"" she said. ""That means that if you can get past the intense sugar cravings the first two weeks, your taste buds will adjust to find natural foods with sugar more satisfying."" Hinder the habit We are creatures of routine and ritual. Just like when a person might crave smoking (say after eating), figure out what your habitual trigger is and try to replace it. Bored at your desk? Call a friend before you reach for a soda. Counter the caffeine If you've not been drinking caffeine-free soda, then a good part of your addition to that soft drink is the caffeine buzz you're getting. Try substituting green or black tea instead, Al Bochi said. ""You'll get the caffeine boost you're looking for without the added sugar and you'll also be getting a good dose of antioxidants,"" she added. ""Herbal teas like hibiscus, passion fruit, berry, peppermint are flavorful and pleasing without contributing any sugar or calories,"" suggested Drayer. Woo the water Carry a water bottle with you or have a pitcher of ice cold water near your desk. If it's easily accessible to you, you are more likely to grab the water than a sugary beverage.  If you're not a fan of plain water, Drayer suggested adding a little sparkle. ""Try infusing fruit into water -- you can purchase a pitcher, fill it with water, then add slices of oranges, lemons, strawberries, watermelon or whatever fruit you like so the water will become infused with the fruit flavor and provide sweetness to your palate,"" she said. Embrace the effort And finally, allow yourself a slip now and then. ""Remember that drinking a sugary beverage every once in a while will not directly cause adverse health effects,"" said Al Bochi. ""Providing yourself permission to enjoy all beverages while being mindful with how it fits into your overall healthy eating pattern is the key to a healthy relationship with food."""
38,The healthiest water to drink: Is there such a thing?,"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 08:57:40 GMT",The science is clear: Staying hydrated and drinking enough water has health benefits.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/1h4IUSrFiI4/index.html,"Hydration can help lubricate and cushion joints, protect sensitive tissues in your body, flush out waste and keep your immune system and even your skin healthy. Yet when it comes to bottled water, there are several types on the market: spring, purified, mineral, artesian and even alkaline. Is any type best? It turns out that might come down to personal preference, as more research seems to be needed for a definitive answer. ""For the price, I'm going to get spring water,"" said Dr. Eddie Fatakhov, a physician and nutritionist at the Center for Internal and Integrative Medicine in Alpharetta, Georgia. ""Because I know it came from the spring."" Spring, purified, mineral, artesian: What's the difference? Spring water comes from an underground source and must be collected at the spring or through a borehole tapping the spring's source, according to the International Bottled Water Association.  The association defines purified water as water that has been highly treated -- through distillation, deionization or other suitable processes -- in order to meet certain standards before being sold. Mineral water is natural water that has a constant level and relative proportions of mineral and trace elements -- containing no less than 250 parts per million total of dissolved solids, according to the water association. No minerals can be added to it. Then there's artesian water, which is derived from a well that taps a specific layer of rock or sand.  You also might have seen alkaline water on store shelves; it has a higher pH level than tap water. A pH level is a measure of how acidic or basic water is. Seven is a neutral pH. Higher pH levels are more alkaline, or basic; lower pH levels are more acidic. ""Tap water has a pH of roughly around 7, and alkaline water is closer to about 8 or 9,"" Malina Malkani, a registered dietician nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told CNN in January.  Could alkaline water provide any special health benefits? ""There's really not a lot of evidence either supporting of the health claims that are made about alkaline water or refuting the claims,"" Malkani said.  In other words, the jury is still out. Malkani noted that ""if all the body systems are functioning as they should be, the blood pH isn't going to vary too much. So it's a misconception that you can, by drinking an alkaline water, drastically affect the pH of the body."" Illnesses are common causes for changes in the blood pH level. Diabetes can make your blood more acidic, but kidney problems can make it more alkaline. Certain foods, including dairy products, also can make your blood more acidic. It is more common for companies to manufacture alkaline water, but natural alkaline water can occur when water picks up minerals from areas such as springs, when it passes over rocks in the environment. ""Alkaline compounds are salts and metals that, when added to water, make it more basic,"" Malkani said. All in all, the general consensus among health experts for now is that making sure you are drinking enough water is more important than the type of water you prefer. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend that men drink an average of about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) of water each day and that women drink about 2.7 liters (91 ounces). That water can come from beverages and foods, according to the recommendations. So, for men and women respectively, ""that's 15 cups of water and 11 cups of water, from the eight cups we were taught to believe,"" Fatakhov said. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding need additional fluids to stay hydrated, according to the Mayo Clinic, which noted that the Office on Women's Health recommends that women who breastfeed consume about 13 cups of fluids a day. ""America is dehydrated,"" Fatakhov said, and that's a problem because ""83% of your lungs is water. If you take the heart and the brain, 73% is water. If you take the bones, about 31% is water. If you take the kidneys and muscles, about 76% is water. Your body is made up of water.""  'Water boosts energy' Water not only benefits your health, it could help you control your weight. A study published in the Annals of Family Medicine in 2016 found a significant association between not being adequately hydrated and having an elevated body mass index, known as BMI. BMI is determined based on a person's height and weight. Having a BMI of 30 or higher is categorized as obese. The study was based on data from 9,528 people ages 18 to 64, whose levels of hydration were measured in urine samples. Those whose samples showed inadequate hydration tended to have higher BMIs and higher odds of being obese, compared with the hydrated adults. Water can benefit weight management because staying hydrated helps you better understand when you are actually hungry, and it can boost your metabolism and energy. ""Because of our high water content, it makes sense that our bodies need water to keep our systems functioning. So the next time you hit that afternoon slump, drink a glass of water to increase your energy levels,"" Fatakhov said. ""Think about it like this: I tell you to drink water, and you drink water. Your body has to convert that water back to your body temperature. So if you drink cold water, your body has to turn it back to body temperature,"" he said. ""That's why they say it's better to drink cold water than hot water if you're trying to burn calories."" If you think you're not drinking enough water, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers some tips:  Carry a water bottle with you throughout the day for easy access to water.Choose water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages, even when eating out.Add a wedge of lime or lemon to water to help improve taste.Try chilling freezer-safe water bottles for easy access to ice-cold water throughout the day."

And now pecan. And that doesn't even include the creamy versions, filled with varying nut butters. We might have too many Snickers bars, honestly.  The idea for this particular bar came from fans, with the company asking customers what nut they would like to see next. Lo and behold, pecans won, beating out cashews, pistachios and macadamia nuts.  The Snickers Pecan Bar is also one of the only Snickers bars that doesn't include peanuts. Both this and the almond version swap out peanuts, while the others simply add extra ingredients. So if you're allergic to peanuts this might be the candy for you.  The new bar is also partly an ode to Texas, where the company says many of the original bars are produced and where the pecans come from. The box even reads ""Texas Proud"" on the top and side, along with the phrase. ""Fixin' to satisfy."" Note the missing 'g.'"
43,The impeachment battle is a political earthquake. Here's what it means for stocks,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 16:25:01 GMT",The American economy's chances of entering a recession are growing. The US-China trade war is still raging. And now President Donald Trump faces the specter of impeachment.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/DR31_dYZ8aI/index.html,"These are tricky times for investors. At a minimum, the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry adds to the mounting uncertainties hovering above markets.  And no matter how far the impeachment proceedings go, this is yet one more question mark clouding the outlook for the longest economic expansion and the longest bull market in American history. ""We don't have a playbook for this,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Although the start of impeachment proceedings is a political earthquake in Washington, the consequences for Wall Street could be far be less profound. Investors, for now, seem willing to view it as a mere sideshow.  ""The market will see through any short-term challenges and realize it's more political theater than anything that will fundamentally impact the economy,"" said Daryl Jones, director of research at Hedgeye Risk Management. Investors are hardly freaking out. US stocks retreated on Tuesday, but impeachment was just one of several factors dragging the market lower. And stocks moved mostly higher on Wednesday even after the White House released a transcript that showed Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.  So far, markets are betting the political drama won't alter the fundamentals: corporate profits and economic growth. That's especially because investors know there is a very high threshold to remove a president from office. Not only would the House have to vote to impeach Trump, but two-thirds of the Senate would need to convict him.  ""I don't think impeachment proceedings will spill over into the real economy,"" said Jones.  What does this mean for the trade war? But that thinking could change if the latest political scandal shifts the chances of a US-China trade agreement, rattles American consumers or improves the odds of a less market-friendly president taking the White House in 2021.  The trade war remains Wall Street's biggest fear.  The unprecedented tariff battle between the United States and China has created vast uncertainty, pressured manufacturing, forced companies to overhaul supply chains and raised costs for businesses and consumers. The trade war alone could spark a recession in the United States.  Impeachment could prove to be a negative for Wall Street if it lowers the chances of a trade agreement, or leads to an escalation of tensions. If Beijing believes the White House has been damaged by the current scandal, it could decide to sit back and wait until after the 2020 election. ""How much will China be willing to negotiate if they see a weakened president?"" asked Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corporation. Chris Krueger, managing director at the Cowen Washington Research Group, warned that the impeachment scandal could distract the White House from trade talks. ""Perhaps Trump can't/won't engage in the high stakes diplomacy to break the US-China impasse,"" Krueger wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Others argue that the new scandal could force Trump to look for a big win before the election by reaching an historic trade agreement with China.  That, of course, would be a huge positive for stocks by removing one of the biggest negatives holding back the economy. Will consumer spending remain strong? Beyond China, investors will be on high-alert for any sign that the political drama in Washington might slow the economy.  The most obvious way that could happen would be by denting consumer spending, which has largely remained resilient throughout the trade war and other recent political controversies.  ""A crescendo of bad news can move an economy driven by the consumer,"" said Hogan. ""Is this something that causes people to put off buying that sweater, fridge or car?"" Meanwhile, the impeachment fight adds to policy uncertainty ahead of the 2020 election. One major question is whether it will help or hurt Trump's reelection chances. Investors could grow nervous if the scandal increases the chances of a less business-friendly president in 2021. ""The market has some misgivings about a President Warren or Sanders,"" said Colas. ""The market is probably okay with a President Biden."" Markets boomed in the late '90s History offers limited examples of how the market performs during impeachment proceedings. And those examples, of course, didn't happen in the middle of a trade war. For instance, the US stock market was already mired in a bear market in 1974, the year President Richard Nixon resigned to avoid his own impeachment and likely conviction. At the time, the economy was crippled by the OPEC oil embargo and high inflation. The political crisis did not help. More recently, the S&P 500 advanced 28% between the start of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in January 1998 and President Bill Clinton's acquittal by the Senate in February 1999, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The stock market did plunge nearly 20% in the summer of 1998, but that tumble was driven by the Russian debt crisis and the near-collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. The S&P 500 recovered from that scare and ended up hitting new highs months before Clinton was acquitted.  Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, thinks the market will survive this political drama, too. ""While the current crisis will certainly add to the market's wall of worry,"" Stovall wrote in an email, ""we don't think it will lead to recession and therefore will not result in a new bear market."""
44,Influencers prepare for an Instagram without likes,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:55:16 GMT","With over 23,000 followers on Instagram, Sam McAllister may not have quite as big of an audience as influencers like Kim Kardashian or Lele Pons. But one of McAllister's major selling points has been his number of likes.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/J1yZrMbfnUY/index.html,"It's not uncommon for an Instagram post from McAllister, a 23-year-old photographer, to rack up more than 1,000 likes. One breathtaking photo of a Venice, Italy canal shot from above received nearly 6,000 likes. Another shot of the Eiffel Tower topped 4,000. With that level of engagement, he's managed to build a side hustle, doing work on paid campaigns for companies such as airline Aer Lingus and an energy drink maker.  But now, he's wary that brands could pass him over for opportunities. In recent months, Instagram has been testing hiding likes in several countries, including Ireland, where McAllister lives, as well as Australia and New Zealand. ""The fact that my posts are massively engaged has paid off for me,"" McAllister, whose day job is working at payments startup Stripe, told CNN Business. ""My main concern right now is that the number of followers a user has now defaults to be the main metric."" Related: Risk Takers: The 20 leaders pushing global business forward Instagram has framed the move as an attempt to ""reduce pressure"" on the platform. The thinking: not getting enough likes can negatively impact some users' self-esteem. But with this one tweak, Instagram could rattle some social media influencers like McAllister who've worked to build a business on the platform, forcing them to adapt and make changes to their strategy.  ""We understand that the number of likes is an important metric for many creators, and while this test is in exploratory stages, we are thinking through ways for creators to communicate value to their partners,"" a spokesperson for Facebook (FB), which owns Instagram, told CNN Business.  Inside this still nascent industry, influencers and marketers are now openly debating how detrimental the impact of this change could be. Some, like Kamiu Lee, CEO of influencer marketing platform Activate, expect it will initially create ""confusion,"" but she predicts the industry will ""figure it out"" in the long-term. Others, including Felicity Palmateer, a professional surfer from Australia with 184,000 Instagram followers, said hiding likes could make it that much harder for aspiring influencers to break into the industry.  ""It sucks for people who have [high] engagement, but not as many followers,"" she said. ""I'd be pissed off.""  How the Instagram influencer industry works today In just under a decade since Instagram launched, a growing number of celebrities, fitness gurus, fashion bloggers, interior designers, authors, and more have turned to the photo-centric social network to build a following and a new revenue stream. Once established on Instagram, many influencers branch out with branded content, product lines, podcasts, books, and even their own online courses on how to build a social media following.   At the heart of this industry is a simple premise: people can turn their popularity into profit. Sometimes, a lot of profit. The most highly-paid influencers such as Kylie Jenner can make more than $1 million per Instagram post, according to one report.  Related: Risk Takers: The 20 leaders pushing global business forward Brands will often partner with social media stars on sponsored Instagram posts to reach that person's unique audience. When brands consider partnering with an influencer, they take into account factors such as likes, comments, followers and what type of content they post.  Before working with an influencer, brands typically will ask for screenshots of the influencer's back-end Instagram analytics, which offer more in-depth information such as the age ranges and gender breakdown of their followers, which countries their audience is located in and how many accounts a certain post reached.  Lee's firm calculates engagement by adding likes and comments divided by followers. If likes go, then the value of them will be ""devalued,"" Lee said. Hiding likes could create ""near-term inefficiencies in how some of these deals get done,"" she said. Not all influencers are worried. As Roz Purcell, an Irish influencer with nearly 300,000 followers on Instagram, put it: ""We're all just going to have to evolve."" Life after likes  As with so many changes in the tech industry, Instagram's move could have wide and unknown consequences. That may range from people possibly ""liking"" fewer posts to making it harder to discern who bought fake followers.  Several influencers and marketers told CNN Business there is concern that hiding likes will make it harder to sniff out which accounts have bought fake followers to fraudulently inflate their popularity. Previously brands -- and average users -- could see that an account with one million followers only received 50 likes on a photo, and determine that its follower count was probably fake.  Instagram has been working to crack down on this practice, which is against its policies.  ""When we find spammy activity, we work to counter and prevent it, including blocking accounts and removing violating content. We're also constantly working to improve our technology in this area. ... Every day we block millions of fake accounts at registration,"" the Facebook spokesperson said.  Still experts see reason to be optimistic about hidden likes.  Joe Gagliese, CEO of Viral Nation, a firm that connects companies with influencers for deals, said brands should be looking beyond likes anyway. He argues they should take into account information such as the influencer's audience demographics and how well their persona matches with the brand and its values.  ""That vanity number isn't a representation of how powerful someone can be,"" he said. ""Likes are a very casual form of engagement. A lot of people like stuff without even really looking at it or they're so used to tapping the like button."""

However, it may take 15 days or longer for some users to see the feature, according to the company. Dark mode is a preferred appearance for some users because it's easier on the eyes. The company says it also prolongs battery life; darker pixels require less power than lighter ones. The move is part of a larger trend: It's become increasingly popular on several platforms and devices, including Twitter, Samsung Galaxy smartphones, Google's Chrome browser and Apple's iOS and MacOS software. Apple's support page for installing dark mode on Mac claims the setting ""makes it easier to stay focused on your work, because your content stands out while darkened controls and windows recede into the background."" Facebook is also testing a dark mode, according to multiple reports. For Android 10 users, the dark theme is accessible in the Android Display system setting, and it's enabled in Gmail after the whole operating system is set to dark mode. On Pixel devices, Gmail will default to the dark theme when Battery Saver mode is activated. For iPhone users, it depends on which version of iOS you have. With iOS 11 and iOS 12, the dark theme can be accessed in the Settings section. With the newly released iOS 13, users can either go to the settings in Gmail or they can automatically enable the feature when they set their device to dark mode.  Google teased the new option during the Android 10 release a few weeks ago. The new operating system also has a dark theme that changes colors for the phone's menus and home screen, but only some apps support it. "
47,Trump's Ukraine call was incredibly stupid,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 23:44:20 GMT",Trump's decision to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political opponent one day after the country heard special counsel Robert Mueller testify before Congress suggests a man with a political death wish.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/DuxEtOLQ0bk/index.html,"Now, after a career built on demanding attention but evading meaningful scrutiny, Donald Trump is facing accountability for the first time in his life. Trump is struggling to respond to revelations that he pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. And judging from his babbling public performance before reporters at the UN General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, he does not know how to cope. As usual, the President talked about a ""witch hunt"" and ""fake news"" and popularity polls as he spoke in the hoarse voice that seems to come over him in moments of stress. Then he damaged the case for his own defense, saying that if then-Vice President Joe Biden had sought a favor from Ukraine in 2015, it would have constituted an ""impeachable event.""  There's no proof that Biden sought favors from Ukraine. In fact the idea that he did is refuted in original reports on the matter. But a rough White House transcript of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows that the President did exactly what he'd suggested Biden had done. ""I would like you to do us a favor,"" Trump said to Zelensky, according to the White House transcript of the call. ""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son. That Biden stopped the prosecutions and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. ... It sounds horrible to me."" If there's ""a lot of talk"" about Biden's son, it has been generated mainly by the President, his supporters and his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Trump told Zelensky that both Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani would be calling the Ukrainian President. As Biden has long occupied the front-runner position in the Democratic primary, Trump has cause to fear him -- and to try to undermine him. But urging Ukraine to investigate Biden's son constitutes an abuse of the public trust.  Why would Trump use a phone call with a foreign leader to ask for a blatantly personal and political favor? I would suggest that Trump expects the government to function like his personal business -- and as a result he can't imagine that anything he might desire would be out of bounds for a president. Throughout his life, Trump has operated under special conditions that allowed him to get away with almost anything.  The classic example came when his extremely wealthy father bailed out his casino by purchasing $3.5 million worth of chips at a blackjack table and then left the casino without gambling. This gambit broke state regulations, but the resulting fine -- $30,000 -- was paltry, and the deposit provided much-needed cashflow. Family wealth bailed Trump out of other difficulties and made it possible for him to take risks that others would have avoided. Bankruptcy followed bankruptcy, but because Trump's family money was protected by corporate structures, he maintained his high-profile lifestyle and kept on promoting himself as a super-successful businessman. He spread lies about the prominent women who had allegedly pursued him as a romantic partner, and he offered wildly varying claims about his personal wealth. Trump has even said that his net worth depends on how he feels at a given moment.  The truth about Trump remained elusive because so much of what he claimed could not be verified. His privately held businesses were not required to produce accurate public financial reports, and they never did. Meanwhile, how do you determine whether, as Trump claimed, he had once been one of the best young baseball players in New York?  As his biographer, I put time into checking Trump's claims and discovered that many, like the one about his baseball prowess, were false. These lies didn't threaten the whole country when he was just the clown prince of New York real estate and a reality TV show host boasting, falsely, about his ratings. But now that Trump is President, all the bluster that may have seemed amusing and harmless to those who stayed outside Trump's orbit has plunged the nation into a constitutional crisis. What we've seen in just this one Trump scandal -- and there are many more -- suggests that the President is incapable of fulfilling his duties and may even be driven by self-destructive impulses.  As Trump acknowledged last week, a president's calls with foreign leaders are overheard by other US officials, who take notes. Given this knowledge, Trump's attempt to enlist Zelensky in his harebrained scheme was not just an abuse of public trust; it also demonstrates Trump's true beliefs about human nature. Who could be surprised that a national security official filed a whistleblower complaint about that phone call with Zelensky? Only a person who assumes that no one else ever acts out of a sense of ethical and moral duty. What Trump seems to have ignored is that the American President operates in a system designed to check abuses -- and that the government he heads might be filled with people of conscience. As this scandal unfolds, the administration will come to learn the meaning of accountability. For Trump personally, it will be the first time."
48,"Iran, don't use American hostages as pawns","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 23:42:10 GMT","Last December, six families penned an impassioned open letter to the world pleading for assistance in securing the release of their loved ones unjustly detained in Iran. Many of these families are still waiting for the world to heed their call for the safe return of their fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/yjulsnytciY/index.html,"  This week, as world leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly, they must use this opportunity to bring up their cases with Iranian officials and call for their immediate release.   For many years, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have joined together in bipartisan calls for the return of these Americans and others. That unity is necessary to bring the full weight of the United States, and the power of the entire world, behind the release of these hostages. We must continue the fight until our fellow Americans are home safe.    Since 2010, I have had the honor of representing Robert Levinson, the longest-held hostage in American history. Bob went missing from Iran's Kish Island in March 2007. In the years since his disappearance, his family has missed him through celebrations and milestones, with only a ""proof of life"" video and pictures to sustain their hope for his homecoming.    When Bob was imprisoned in 2007, the international community had just concluded failed negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.  In the years following, Iran unjustly and arbitrarily detained more and more foreign and dual nationals.  After the election of Hassan Rouhani in 2013, President Barack Obama pursued negotiations with Iran that granted the United States a chance to raise the issue of detained Americans. Many of my colleagues in Congress and I repeatedly implored the administration to focus on this issue. The world breathed a collective sigh of relief in January 2016, when five Americans were released from Iran. Unfortunately, too many, including Bob, were left behind. He, and others -- like Baquer and Siamak Namazi, and Xiyue Wang -- have suffered harrowing conditions and punishment at the hands of Iranian leaders.  Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with legal permanent resident status in the United States, endured four long years in detention in Iran's notorious Evin Prison.    In an interview with The Atlantic after his release in June 2019, he said, ""When you are a hostage, you need to know that the world is talking about you.""    But the Levinsons and other families cannot continue to wait on the world to act. This week more than 100 international leaders have taken the stage at the UN to speak about their country's priorities and attend countless bilateral and multilateral meetings. They will walk the halls alongside the Iranian delegation. Some will meet face to face with Iran.   The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or Iran nuclear deal), Iran's support for terrorism, and recent acts of aggression in the Gulf will be on the agenda. American hostages must be on the agenda as well.   Every world leader must bring up Bob and the others detained. In every speech, in every meeting, and in every interaction, every leader, especially United States officials and even President Trump, must demand the release of foreign nationals from Iran. They must say their names so there can be no mistake that the world demands their release. We cannot allow these individuals to continue to be used as pawns in a dangerous game with Iran. The United Nations' own Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD) has ruled on many of these cases. In November 2016, UNWGAD found Iran responsible for the arbitrary detention of Robert Levinson.    This July, Bob missed the birth of his ninth grandchild. He has missed too much. He, and the rest of those unjustly detained by Iran, must be released on humanitarian grounds. The world is watching what happens in New York. Do not let this year's General Assembly session go to waste. The United States must lead the international effort to bring our fellow Americans home."
49,Trump voters are waiting ... and watching,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:06:23 GMT","​When the euphoria from the announcement that the US House will pursue an impeachment inquiry of President Trump wears off for Democrats and others who oppose Trump's administration, and all the talking heads have spoken, remember this -- it's important: Trump didn't change the country; he revealed it.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Bq24suWcluI/index.html,"The latest chapter in the most bizarre political saga in modern memory may very well lead to Trump's removal. Or it may not.  It may encourage Americans to follow the news more closely, it may prompt them to stay further away. It could derail Trump's re-election bid or provide his supporters with an energizing rallying cry. Certainly Trump's team is hoping for the latter, considering that Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Bradley Parscale, tweeted, ""Democrats have officially paved the way for a @realDonaldTrump landslide victory. The witch-hunt continues,"" which feels like a stretch considering Trump comfortably lost the popular vote and his Electoral College victory margin ranked 46th of 58 US elections.  Regardless of Parscale's misplaced bravado, the real issue isn't what happens to Trump anyway. It's what happens to the nearly 63 million people who voted for him.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is correct: ""No one is above the law."" But for many who voted for Trump in the first place, this development isn't about the law, the Constitution or the sanctity of democracy. It is about winning. And if being willfully ignorant of Trump's alleged misdeeds helps Republicans win, they'll take it. This is why some of the same conservatives who greeted President Obama wearing a tan suit with hostility treat Trump allegedly withholding military aid in an attempt to pressure a foreign nation to investigate a political foe as no big deal. When the goal is to do what's best for the country, an impeachment inquiry is ideally a bipartisan effort to make sure the most powerful man in the world is not abusing his power. When the goal is to win, such an inquiry is viewed as an opponent that must be defeated.  We call it ""party over country,"" an environment Trump did not create but one he is clearly benefiting from. Given his recent admission that he discussed Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I do believe impeachment is the proper action. I also believe because Trump is so disliked by a portion of America that many will make the mistake of conflating their feelings about him personally with the crimes he's accused of committing. And will enjoy a measure of satisfaction.  But it does not provide an exit off this debilitating national hamster wheel we're on. For be not mistaken, choosing party over patriotism is not an exclusively Republican affliction. There are countless Americans on both sides of the aisle who did not bother to read the Mueller report but will cherry-pick all their favorite quotes to support what they are already believe. You can't do what's best for the country when you're preoccupied with winning. Pelosi on Tuesday did the right thing for the country. But now, will she and the Democrats resist the temptation to do what's best for themselves?  Liberals may not care, but the nearly 63 million who voted for Trump will be watching ... and they're not going anywhere, even if Trump does. "
50,Did Trump betray his country?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 05:42:47 GMT","The Trump-Ukraine story might seem complicated and there is much that we still have to learn, but the implications are clear: President Donald Trump apparently betrayed his country, and now, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced, his actions have triggered a formal impeachment inquiry.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/QRqlCSsi0eI/index.html,"His administration refused to share with Congress an urgent whistleblower complaint by an intelligence agent (although sources familiar with the matter say it may be released Wednesday), so we don't yet know the full details.   Still, media investigations have revealed the main outlines of the story: In July, Trump withheld military aid while pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to look into discredited allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's leading challenger in the 2020 election. Trump has acknowledged that he spoke with Zelensky about corruption and about Biden. Trump would have us believe that this is all perfectly normal, and that his withholding of the military aid had nothing to do with his desire for an investigation of Biden. (On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he would release the ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky"" Wednesday.) But none of this is normal. In fact, if Trump was trying to make a deal with the President of Ukraine, it was a crass move that put his personal political interests above those of the country he swore to serve. Trump's actions toward Ukraine are likely a violation of anti-corruption laws, on top of his apparent violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act. More importantly, Trump's behavior constitutes a violation of his oath of office, of his vow to ""protect and defend"" his nation, of the trust of the American people and of the most fundamental duties he accepted when he became President of the United States. The apparent extortion of Ukraine is far worse than his solicitation and acceptance of Russian help to win in 2016. We'll see what the transcript of the call reveals, but it's worth noting that CNN reports the call is only part of the whistleblower complaint. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says that the whistleblower wants to testify before the committee.  When candidate Trump asked the Kremlin to help him defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- saying, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"" -- it was a despicable move to solicit assistance from a hostile power to influence an American election. But at the time Trump was a private citizen, without access to the vast power and resources of the executive branch. This time, the President has engaged in what looks very much like extortion: demanding help smearing Biden in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid, and pressuring a desperate country to interfere in the 2020 US elections to help Trump tarnish the Democratic frontrunner. On Tuesday, Trump again insisted he'd done nothing wrong and offered a new explanation for why he had withheld military aid, claiming that he'd done so because ""Europe and other nations"" were not contributing to helping Ukraine. That claim is false, and wouldn't justify the administration in pressuring Ukraine to investigate an opponent, or refusing to comply with a whistleblower law. To all appearances, Trump has put pressure on Ukraine by hijacking $250 million dollars of US taxpayers' money that Congress had voted to give Ukraine so it could strengthen its defenses against its aggressive neighbor, Russia -- the country that helped Trump win the presidency in 2016. The White House and Congress clashed bitterly over Trump's refusal to release these approved funds. After all, Congress made a decision based on what it believed was in the best interest of US national security. Trump did release the money -- after the whistleblower complaint was filed and was declared an ""urgent concern"" by the nonpartisan inspector general.  When Trump told President Zelensky last July to investigate Joe Biden and his son -- Trump made the demand about eight times in one conversation, according to the Wall Street Journal -- he was, at minimum, implicitly threatening that Ukraine's relationship with the United States, including military aid, was at stake. Whether or not he phrased it in such crass terms is only marginally important. In pressuring Ukraine like this, Trump is leaving the country with a crushingly difficult choice. At the moment, the country is doing battle with Russian-backed, Russian-armed rebels, just five years after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea, and Russia continues actively assaulting Ukrainian sovereignty. On the call with Zelensky, Trump insisted that Ukraine deal with his attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. According to Ukraine's summary of the call, Trump expressed optimism that the new Ukrainian government would forcefully pursue ""corruption cases"" which inhibited the interaction between the two countries. In the White House description of the call, which does not appear on the White House website, Trump congratulated President Zelensky on the latter's election and ""discussed ways to strengthen cooperation."" There was no mention of investigations in the White House description of the July call.   A crucial, disturbing aspect of this scandal is that it breathes life into Trump's unsubstantiated accusations against Biden. Trump loyalists are telling Fox News viewers that there's a real scandal here, even though Ukrainian prosecutors insist the former Vice President did nothing wrong.  In addition to breaking faith with US voters and undermining the US national interest, the apparent extortion attempt may well qualify as criminal conduct under the Hobbs Act, a statute that bans public officials from demanding something of value in exchange for carrying out the duties of their office.  Trump, to all accounts, demanded something of value from the Ukrainian President: namely, help tarnishing his political rival. And he did not carry out the duty of disbursing legally mandated aid until September 11, weeks after the whistleblower had filed his complaint.  Along with Pelosi, another central figure who has been reluctant to call for impeachment appears to be changing his mind.  Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that he is not yet sure whether the Ukraine call was the subject of the whistleblower complaint, but that if a sitting president's telephone call with a foreign leader ""involve(d) potential corruption or criminality,"" or was used for ""political advantage against our nation's interest,"" then that would be the gravest violation yet of this presidency -- or perhaps of ""any presidency."" If that is indeed what happened, and the signs strongly suggest it is, then Trump's behavior makes Watergate look like petty pickpocketing. Trump likely betrayed his country, and he did it on the world stage, using taxpayers' money and toying with American security. What could be worse?"
51,My love for 'The Brady Bunch' is complicated,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 09:52:38 GMT","We all know the premise of ""The Brady Bunch,"" the ABC hit that ran for five seasons starting in 1969: A lovely lady met a man named Brady and they knew their love was much more than a hunch. And the rest is history -- or, in this case, 117 episodes.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/GQpwWQihdlE/index.html,"This week the classic sitcom celebrates the 50th anniversary of its very first episode. Remember Mike and Carol's wedding? Remember the cake incident? It's become iconic, and that single episode kicked off a cultural phenomenon that spawned catchphrases (""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!""), spin-offs (""The Brady Brides"") and a never-ending supply of Brady merchandise (everything from records to lunch boxes).  The fact that these characters have managed to have such cross-generational appeal speaks to the power of the show. You don't find many shows that both baby boomers and Gen-Xers love, but you have that with the Bradys. They were one of the first blended families on TV and spoke of the ""generation gap"" between children and their parents.  But while the nostalgia factor is clearly still alive, times have certainly changed. Life in the early 1970s is vastly different from life in 2019, and as much as I love the show for the memories it's given me, there's no denying that some things are dated.  This month, HGTV debuted ""A Very Brady Renovation,"" which follows the six Brady kids (well, adults...) as they transform the inside of the famous California home that was used for the exterior shots of the show. Did I mention that they're renovating the home to look exactly like the show's set? The finished product will be classic Brady and a true homage to the series -- all the way down to the blue and pink wallpaper in the girls' room!  It's an interesting premise, to be sure, but it also got me thinking: What if the Bradys were just gracing our screens for the first time in 2019? Could you literally transport it from 1969 and plop it in today's world just like they're doing by redecorating the house? I doubt the show would translate well. It would quickly become a victim of that generation gap the characters bemoaned some 50 years ago.  For half a century, it's been hard to escape the show's influence. We've all found ourselves wrapped up in the Brady bubble at some point, even if we didn't watch during the original run. I was born a full seven years after the show ended, long after the gang hung up their bell bottoms and stopped singing about sunshine days. And still, the show (and most importantly, the Bradys themselves) were such an integral part of my childhood.  Thanks to reruns, I got to laugh, cry and learn right along with them. Whereas my mom grew up when the show was first on and dreamed of being Marcia, I fell in love with it in the early 1990s thanks to reruns and dreamed of groovy Greg, the Casanova of Clinton Avenue. ""It's very safe and friendly and nice,"" said Eve Plumb, who played middle sister Jan to E! about the show's appeal -- and I agree. Everything was wrapped up in a cute little bow by the time each episode ended and, of course, a lesson was always learned. As Plumb put it,""When you go to watch 'The Brady Bunch', you know that a problem will be solved and people love each other."" But there are aspects of the show that haven't aged as well as that catchy theme song. The storylines, for starters. We saw the Brady kids deal with things like peer pressure to smoke and breaking their mom's favorite vase. Ask kids today about the challenges they face and the exhaustive and scary list includes things like school shootings, cyberbullying, mental health struggles and drugs.  Plus, in watching the show, we're presented with this idea that the transition to blended family is a seamless one; in fact, it's as seamless as that first 25-minute episode. Aside from a few other hiccups in season one, the Bradys rarely ever mention their blended status. The kids even call their stepparents ""mom"" or ""dad,"" as if they've been a family forever, even though we know things like blending a family are never that easy.  The show may have been relatable to adolescents of yesteryear, but much of that relatability would be lost on today's teens. The show rarely mentioned politics, for example. Today that's something we can't ignore, especially with today's Gen Z, who are routinely on the front lines of activism about everything from the climate crisis to gun control. In the end, I'm not sure the sort of charm and innocence we see on ""The Brady Bunch"" can ever be replicated. But maybe that's a good thing. After all, it's that very uniqueness that has helped the show remain such a cultural classic for so many years. We can enjoy and appreciate it as a sort of time capsule of the era, revisiting its lessons any time we want. And in a very meta moment, the biggest lesson of all may come from the Brady kids themselves. As they sang in the Season 3 episode, ""Dough Re Mi"": ""When it's time to change (when it's time to change)...Don't fight the tide, go along for the ride...""   Yes, the Bradys have given us the ride of a lifetime. Bell bottoms and all."
52,Trump's absurd projection reveals his anxiety,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 18:30:13 GMT","Let's talk about projection, the psychological impulse to project on other people what you're actually feeling.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/6dmVbXST6JU/index.html,"Webster's dictionary defines it, in part, as: ""the externalization of blame, guilt, or responsibility as a defense against anxiety.""  Here's one recent, relevant example: ""The one who's got the problem is Biden, because if you look at what Biden did, Biden did what they would like to have me do except there's one problem: I didn't do it."" That, of course, was President Donald Trump, trying to deflect accusations about the covered-up whistleblower's complaint. It reportedly raised concerns about his call with the Ukrainian President, during which, Trump has essentially admitted, he asked for dirt on a political rival's family. Projection is a regular part of the Trump playbook. He's taken the impulse and elevated it to an effective political tactic. For example, during the 2016 campaign, his favorite attack on his final GOP rival for the nomination was to call him ""Lyin' Ted."" Of course, this comes from a person who lied throughout the campaign and has lied more than 12,000 times as president, according to The Washington Post. Cruz was pretty quick to diagnose the problem: ""This man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And he had a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook. His response is to accuse everybody else of lying.""  This impulse to deflect and project continued in the general election against Hillary Clinton. So, when Trump was accused of being the ""most corrupt candidate ever,"" she became ""Crooked Hillary."" When Trump came under fire for racist appeals, he called Clinton a ""bigot.""  When Clinton raised questions about Trump's erratic and impulsive behavior, he called her unstable, unhinged, lacking the ""judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country."" And who can forget his, ""No puppet ... You're the puppet,"" response when she accused him in a debate of being a puppet for Vladimir Putin.  To be sure, that one was more of an impulsive bleat than evidence of strategy, but of course the pattern of projection has continued in the White House:   For example, during the Mueller investigation, when he kept asserting without evidence that ""there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats."" And in saying that Russia really wanted Clinton to win -- despite Putin saying the exact opposite. These projections may be absurd, but they serve a serious political purpose. They muddy the water between fact and fiction and make people think that everyone is guilty of what Trump's been credibly accused of. This increases apathy and cynicism in our democracy by aiming to obliterate citizens' ability to recognize reality.  Because tone comes from the top, you see the President's surrogates and even Cabinet officials echo it. But sometimes they go too far and give away the game. Case in point, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on ""Face The Nation"":  ""If there was election interference that took place by the Vice President, I think the American people deserve to know.""  I'm sorry, what's that now? Because literally no one is suggesting that Joe Biden was involved in election interference. But, of course, that's exactly what President Trump is being accused of, and if you can't defend the President's alleged actions, you just deflect and project. Here's the thing: Projection is actually a sign of deep insecurity. Which makes you wonder about the President's favorite insults, which he deploys over and over again on Twitter. An analysis by The Washington Post's Philip Bump found that his top five insults were ""fake,"" ""failed,"" ""dishonest,"" ""weak"" and ""liar."" It's enough to make you think President Trump doesn't actually think of himself as a ""very stable genius"" after all."
53,Boris Johnson owes the Queen an apology,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:43:03 GMT","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had planned a safe environment for his speech Tuesday in New York. In the Big Apple for this week's UN General Assembly, he was set to address a select group of business leaders on opportunities in the United Kingdom, in the shadow of the Vessel, a structure recently built by his designer friend Thomas Heatherwick.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/piH77c8Tls8/index.html,"But the morning didn't go according to plan for Johnson. Instead he found himself stammering out a response to a different crisis: a Supreme Court ruling that has sent yet another earthquake through the already fractious landscape of British politics. The United Kingdom's highest court ruled unanimously Tuesday -- with a panel of 11 judges -- that Johnson acted unlawfully when he suspended the British Parliament for five weeks at the end of this summer. There was the usual bluster from Johnson in his reaction -- an assertion that he ""respects"" the judiciary was followed immediately by an insistence that he ""strongly disagrees"" with the legal findings of Britain's preeminent judges. Notably, there was an apology missing. At no point in Johnson's speech did he apologize to Britain's people, or to the Queen.  Why did Boris owe the Queen an apology? Because by upholding a previous ruling by Scotland's Court Session, the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson had misled the sovereign herself. As the head of state, the Queen has to give permission to ""prorogue,"" or suspend, Parliament; Johnson's lawyers had assured her they were acting constitutionally. It is unclear whether the Queen's own team could or should have imposed further scrutiny before they agreed; what is clear is that by his actions, Johnson has significantly imperiled the last seemingly safe component of Britain's shaky constitution: the institution of the monarchy. The royal family are big losers from Johnson's staggeringly embarrassing behavior. No one in Britain can ever quite agree whether and how the Queen counts as a political figure. As a constitutional figurehead, she certainly isn't allowed to pronounce on matters of personal political opinion -- so even when another member of the royal family ventures an opinion on a social matter, whether it's Prince Charles lobbying for organic farming or Meghan Markle talking about the environment, there's always cause for a discussion about whether this royal intervention is ""political."" (Unfairly for Meghan, however, the tabloid press rarely applies the same standards to all of them.) But the Queen also has the power to appoint or dismiss heads of government, supposedly only ever doing so as a formality to confirm the results of an election or a no-confidence vote.  Things get constitutionally murky, however, when the democratic will that the monarch is supposed to endorse becomes too difficult for her to read. She's always supposed to appoint as prime minister the person who is most capable of commanding a majority of democratic representatives in Britain's House of Commons -- but it's not always easy to tell who that person is. In a nation as divided as contemporary Britain, it is likely that no political party will be able to win an overall majority at the next election. It may not even be clear that any party leader is capable of building a working coalition. Theoretically, the Queen should then play a role in selecting the next prime minister -- but is that really acceptable in a modern democracy? The last time she played such a role was in 1963 and -- as depicted recently in the Netflix series ""The Crown"" -- her youthful decision to appoint the aristocratic Alec Douglas-Home was a disaster.  The truth is that the Queen has no democratic accountability -- and therefore in a modern world, she has no moral authority. The idea of her sweeping onto the balcony at Buckingham Palace and announcing her personally preferred prime minister is impossible. Yet at the same time, the monarchy's defenders have long presented the royals as the last bulwark against demagogy and political overreach. The Queen's one job is to act as a check on misbehaving politicians. This week's decision demonstrates that the 21st-century monarchy is no longer capable of doing that job.  It's hardly the monarch's personal fault. Can you imagine what Johnson would have done had she refused to approve a suspension his own attorney general insisted was legal? The forces of Brexit, whose hero Johnson claims to be, base their political power on the mantra that the 2016 referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union was the ultimate expression of democratic will. What fate might await an unelected, hereditary monarch who stood in the way of that will? Turning down Johnson's demands was not a good option. But neither was acquiescing to it.  When Brits are children, many of us are told a happy story about the British monarchy. Why hasn't there been a Hitler in Britain, we ask? Because the Queen exists to stop him, we are told. A fascist prime minister, however many fervent supporters voted him in, would never be able to impose laws of the sort passed by Nazis, because the Queen would stop him. So the story goes. Johnson is not -- however florid the exaggerations of some of his critics -- a Nazi or a fascist. Not remotely. But he has exposed the myth that the Queen holds any power to check the land grabs of a demagogic prime minister intent on breaking the norms. Already, it's not a good time for the monarchy;  Prince Andrew's association with the late convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein should be causing every British citizen to examine just how easily the privileges enjoyed by our royal family have been and can be abused. Andrew (who denies accusations of abuse lodged against him) has called his continued association with Epstein after his conviction a mistake. Now, Johnson has demonstrated that the Queen can't even do her one job: standing up to him. The rest of Britain is left to wonder what on earth the monarchy is for."

57,Boris Johnson to face UK lawmakers as he returns to Parliament,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:33:42 GMT",Lawmakers returned to work on Wednesday after a momentous ruling by the United Kingdom's highest court that found Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament to be unlawful.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/UySzce2KMgM/index.html,"""Welcome back to our place of work,"" House of Commons Speaker John Bercow told MPs, before saying he would ensure the prorogation was ""expunged"" from records and is instead listed as ""adjourned."" This comes after the Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that Johnson's decision to unilaterally prorogue Parliament until mid-October -- just two weeks before the UK is due to leave the European Union -- was ""unlawful, void and of no effect."" Critics quickly called for Johnson to resign in the wake of the decision, but the Prime Minister was defiant, telling reporters in New York as he was at the United Nations General Assembly that while he had ""the utmost respect for our judiciary ... I don't agree with the verdict."" While Bercow confirmed that there won't be Prime Minister's Questions, which normally takes place on Wednesdays -- where Johnson could have faced a grilling -- he said there was ""scope"" for urgent questions, ministerial statements and emergency debate applications. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox began proceedings on Wednesday by defending Johnson's suspension -- which was done on the advice by Cox himself. He then launched a furious and animated tirade at lawmakers, calling Parliament a ""disgrace"" and ""dead."" ""They could vote no confidence at any time, but they're too cowardly. They could agree a motion to allow Parliament to dissolve, but they're too cowardly,"" Cox said. ""This Parliament should have the courage to face the electorate, but it won't, because so many of them are really all about preventing us leaving the European Union."" Despite no PMQs, Johnson's official spokesman said in a briefing on Wednesday that the Prime Minister will speak in the House later on and will address the question of whether the government is still planning a Queen's Speech. The spokesman also reiterated that Johnson remains committed to delivering Brexit on October 31. The Prime Minister insisted on Tuesday that Parliament still needs a Queen's Speech in order to outline parliamentary business. ""We will need a Queen's Speech to set out what we are going to do, and I think frankly that is what the people ... want to see,"" he said. On Wednesday Parliament's upper house, the House of Lords, also announced that it would resume sitting later on in the afternoon at 3 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET). Lawmakers push to hold Johnson accountable According to Britain's PA news agency, senior opposition politician Jon Trickett suggested he would try to bring Johnson to Parliament to explain his actions. ""We want to hear what legal advice he was acting on, why he ended up in court and being ruled in this quite extraordinary way,"" Trickett said, according to PA. ""As the debate goes on and we hear the answers, clearly we will be wondering and making decisions on how to proceed next,"" he added. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn brought his keynote speech forward at Labour's party conference on Tuesday so he and fellow lawmakers could return to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Corbyn unleashed a scathing attack on Johnson, insisting the PM should step down for causing a ""reckless and disastrous plan to crash out of the European Union without a deal."" ""He will never shut down our democracy or silence the voices of us, the people,"" Corbyn told a packed conference hall in the southern English resort of Brighton. ""The government will be held to account for what he has done. ""He thought he could do what he wants, just as he has done all his life,"" Corbyn added."

No one had expected this result.  The last time these two teams faced each other Fiji stormed to a comfortable 68-7 victory but it was a different story in the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium, a venue built in memory of those killed in the 2011 tsunami.  It was the biggest score Uruguay has ever recorded in a World Cup game and it was well worthy of the win against a Fiji side who failed to impress.  ""I'm really proud of my country. We're not the biggest, we're not the tallest, but we came here to win,"" said Uruguay captain Juan Manuel Gaminara. ""We've been preparing for this for four years so I'm really proud of my country."" READ: Samoa escapes double red card as it rallies to win against Russia 'Really good day for Uruguayan rugby' The game started at a hurtling pace with both sides registering an early try but it was Uruguay that emerged as the surprise 24-12 leaders at halftime.  Scores from Juan Manuel Cat, Manuel Diana and Santiago Arata punished a sloppy Fijian outfit that wasted a number of opportunities to cut into Uruguay's 12-point lead. There was an expectation that Fiji would regroup during the break and come out firing but the onslaught never arrived.  The Fijian players continued to make basic errors as Uruguay picked up six additional penalty points to give themselves an unassailable lead.  Uruguay has won soccer's World Cup twice but the country has small pool of rugby talent to choose from -- just 6,000 active players, a number which includes children. On Tuesday, some oddsmakers had priced Uruguay at 50-1 to win against Fiji. ""It's outstanding. It's a really good day for Uruguayan rugby today. I hope everybody could see that, and everybody joins to play rugby in Uruguay, we need more players,"" said Uruguay's Felipe Berchesi, who was named Player of the Match for his performance.  ""We're a really small union but we keep showing the world that we're in a good place and they have to support us because we've proved ourselves strong today.""

This was Fiji's second game of the tournament after defeat by Australia on Saturday and the three days rest between matches perhaps contributed to the lackluster performance.   The side that many had tipped to cause an upset at Japan 2019 is now on the brink of elimination with a path to the quarterfinals now looking unlikely.  ""Everything went wrong today. It's not the result we wanted. It's not the way we wanted the game to go today,"" said Fiji captain Dominiko Waqaniburotu after the match. ""We underestimated a very good Uruguay team in the first outing for them. Congratulations to them.""

""Thanks for this city. Its story is really amazing so it's really a privilege to play here,"" said Manuel Gaminara."

""The (post) office was equally astonished, which is why the police, and subsequently the narcotics department of the City Police Command Linz, was informed."" According to Austrian police, the 24,800 pills were worth around €500,000 ($550,000), though Police Scotland told CNN that the likely UK value of the drugs was around £165,000 ($205,000).  The Netherlands is one of the world's largest drugs producers and earlier this year Dutch customs officials reported that the amount of ecstasy and amphetamines being sent in the post had tripled from 137 kilograms (302 pounds) in 2016 to 460 kilograms in 2018.

The decison follows fans protesting for weeks through walkouts and silent demonstrations during televised soccer games.,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/0jcsqtTTzRI/index.html,"MLS and the Seattle Sounders said the flag is a political symbol, banned under the league's code of conduct for fans. The Seattle Sounders fan group, The Emerald City Supporters, said in a statement on its website that the imagery is a symbol of the fight against fascism, oppression and persecution.   The imagery, three arrows pointed leftward and down, was actually used by a pro-democracy, anti-fascist German paramilitary organization, the Iron Front. They actively fought against the Nazis during their rise to power before World War II. Earlier this year, MLS banned the symbol under their fan code of conduct prohibiting politics in their stadiums.   MLS is overturning that ban after two meetings with Seattle and Portland, Oregon, soccer fan groups and the Independent Supporters Council. The council promotes soccer fan culture and fair treatment of fans at home and away matches. The reversal came after sustained and widespread protests across the league by soccer fans.   ""We look forward to continuing the dialogue, moving away from direct action in the stands on this issue, and instead focusing our energy on making progress around the table,"" the leaders of the supporter groups said in a statement provided by MLS. League President and Deputy Commissioner Mark Abbott told CNN in a statement that the league will be updating the code of conduct for 2020 with a working group to, ""ensure clarity and consistency.""   ""This working group will include representatives from the league office and clubs and work collaboratively with leaders of club supporter groups and a cross-section of diversity and inclusion experts,"" Abbot went on to say. A statement from MLS also reaffirmed, ""its long-time commitment to the values of inclusion and diversity, including opposition to racism, fascism and homophobia and to ensuring that there is no place for repugnant hate speech in MLS stadiums."" How the ban began The Emerald City Supporters flew a flag bearing the Iron Front emblem at a Seattle Sounders match on July 21. ""The three arrows represent our commitment to equality and inclusion,"" the group wrote on their website. ""The three arrows have been a symbol of the fight against fascism, oppression and persecution and to this day continue to represent these important values around the world."" After the match, the fan group received a formal warning from the Seattle Sounders, saying the emblem violated the MLS Fan code of conduct: political signage that represent an association to a political group is not allowed. ""The rights we stand for are not political, they are human rights,"" the group responded.   Fans protests become a movement The move to ban the emblem from all MLS games drew instant criticism and outrage from fans across the league.   The hashtag #AUnitedFront became a rallying cry on social media and signs across the league. Some fans covertly placed the Iron Front arrows on signs, others wore it on shirts and arm bands.  One of the most dramatic protest happened on August 23.  In a major rivalry game between Portland Timbers and the Seattle Sounders, fans on both sides united and stayed silent for first 33 minutes of the game. A joint statement from the two rivals fan groups says it in protest of the MLS ban on the imagery, ""to commemorate 1933, the year the Iron Front was disbanded in Nazi Germany.""  The Portland Timbers fan group, Timbers Army, made their message clear in a post on Twitter. ""What scares you more, MLS?,"" it read. ""Three anti-facist arrows down and to the left?

But upon signup, customers would either see a ""fraudulent communication"" or a notice that the profile that expressed interest is ""unavailable"" depending on where the company was at in its fraud review process, the complaint said. In so doing, the FTC claims, Match risked customers ""falling victim to a romance scam or other form of fraud."" ""We believe that Match.com conned people into paying for subscriptions via messages the company knew were from scammers,"" Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. ""Online dating services obviously shouldn't be using romance scammers as a way to fatten their bottom line."" Match CEO Hesam Hosseini warned about the expected legal action in a strongly worded email sent to Match's leadership team Wednesday morning.  ""The government has demanded tens of millions of dollars to resolve this case, which is completely unreasonable based on the allegation and facts. So we will fight this,"" he wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNN Business. ""Most of what the FTC investigated has been permanently discontinued and is totally irrelevant today."" Hosseini added: ""While this litigation may bring bad headlines, I'm confident in our practices and the great work we do every day."" In a statement on its website about the FTC allegations, Match writes that ""fraud is never good for business, which is why we spend so much time, money and emotional capital to fight it."" The company claims that the FTC is ""mischaracterizing what is encompassed in 'fraudulent,'"" adding that the vast majority of the users in question are ""not romance scams or similar types of fraudsters, but spam, bots, and other users attempting to use the service for their own commercial purposes."" Match is facing other allegations in the FTC complaint, including that it misled customers with a ""confusing and cumbersome cancellation process."" In his email to the leadership team, Hosseini said the cancellation process ""generally takes less than a minute."" He added that during the period that the FTC is focusing on, 84% of subscribers who began the cancellation process were able to complete it within a day. The FTC notes in its complaint that the alleged deceptive business practices in question ceased by mid-2019, or earlier."
65,Army proposes changes to rules on who can be buried in Arlington Cemetery,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 23:57:30 GMT","Faced with a shortage of burial spaces, the US Army announced Wednesday that it has proposed changes to the eligibility criteria for internment at Arlington National Cemetery.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/fy-rbpN6i10/index.html,"The Army said in a statement that while Arlington National Cemetery ""continues to look for ways to expand, that alone will not solve the existing demand for burial space."" ""If no changes are made"" the storied cemetery which dates to the Civil War, which houses the likes of John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft, ""will be closed to new interments by the mid-2050s -- even for Medal of Honor recipients,"" the Army added. ""Arlington National Cemetery is a national shrine for all Americans, but especially those who have served our great nation,"" acting Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy said in the statement announcing the proposed rule change. Under the newly proposed rules, those eligible for interment at the cemetery will now be limited to certain groups including: US service members that were killed in action, recipients of the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star or Purple Heart recipients, former prisoners of war and Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States. Retired veterans who served on active duty will now no longer be automatically eligible for in-ground burial but would be eligible for having their cremated remains interned above ground.  The Army said that the proposed changes were the product of a two and a half year process that involved ""public outreach and surveys -- including feedback from veterans and military service organizations."" That review was prompted by a provision passed by Congress in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which the Army said ""directed the Secretary of the Army to establish revised eligibility criteria to keep the cemetery functioning as an active burial ground 'well into the future' -- defined as 150 years."""
