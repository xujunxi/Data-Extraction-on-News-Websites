0,Boris Johnson says Supreme Court 'wrong' to rule on Parliament suspension,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:07:40 GMT","In angry Commons scenes, the PM goads opposition parties to ""finally face the day of reckoning"" in an election.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49827803,"Boris Johnson has told MPs the Supreme Court was ""wrong to pronounce on a political question at a time of great national controversy"". And he urged smaller parties to table a vote of no confidence in his government to trigger a general election. In extraordinary scenes, Tory MPs applauded as he goaded Jeremy Corbyn over his refusal to back an election. Mr Corbyn told the PM he was ""not fit for office"" and should have resigned after the Supreme Court's verdict. Other MPs also rounded on Mr Johnson for his lack of contrition following the unanimous defeat for the government in the court. Labour's Rachel Reeves said Wednesday's events in Parliament had been ""an horrendous spectacle"". Her colleague, Jess Phillips, said the PM's response to the court judgement looked ""horrendous"" to the public and he should apologise. The SNP's Joanna Cherry - who was one of the lawyers who led the court challenge against the suspension or ""prorogation"" - said the House had been ""treated to the sort of populist rant one expects to hear from a tin-pot dictatorship"".   The BBC's political editor said the Commons was ""an absolute bear pit"", with ""so much vitriol on all sides"". Have seen more hours of the Commons than I care to remember + that was one of most brutal + mad I have ever seen - no shred of remorse from the PM ruled to have broken law yesterday, paltry attempt at answering Corbyn's Qs, a few Labour MPs screaming, 'you should be in jail' End of Twitter post  by @bbclaurak Labour and the SNP have refused to vote for a general election until a no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table. The PM was forced to cut short his visit to the UN in New York to return to the Commons after the UK's highest court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful. He said he ""respected"" the court's verdict, but did not think it should have ruled on a ""political question"". And he dared opposition parties to ""finally face the day of reckoning with the voters"" in an election.     Mr Johnson said: ""I think the people outside this House understand what is happening.  ""Out of sheer selfishness and political cowardice they are unwilling to move aside and let the people have a say. The Leader of the Opposition and his party don't trust the people.  ""All that matters to them is an obsessive desire to overturn the referendum result.""  He said Labour had ""until the House rises today to table a motion of no confidence in the government, and we can have that vote tomorrow (Thursday)"".  ""Or if any of the other smaller parties fancy a go, table the motion, we'll give you time for that vote."" Tory MPs broke into sustained applause - something rarely seen in the Commons - after Mr Johnson's attack on the opposition leader, sparking anger on the Labour benches. Labour has said it does not trust Mr Johnson to obey Parliament's instructions to request a delay to Brexit, which the PM has insisted will happen on 31 October, with or without a deal.  Mr Corbyn told the PM he should have ""done the honourable thing and resigned"" after the Supreme Court verdict. ""Quite simply, for the good of this country, he (Mr Johnson) should go,"" he told MPs. ""He says he wants a general election. I want a general election. It's very simple - if you want an election, get an extension and let's have an election."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford said: ""We cannot trust this prime minister, his time must be up. His days of lying, of cheating and of undermining the rule of law..."" Commons Speaker John Bercow asked Mr Blackford to withdraw the ""lying"" comment as it broke Commons rules. Mr Blackford added: ""Do the right thing and do it now, prime minister. End this dictatorship, will you now resign?"" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson called on Mr Johnson to apologise to the Commons following the court judgement. She later tweeted that the prime minister was an ""utter disgrace"" for responding to Labour MP Paula Sheriff's plea for him to stop using ""inflammatory"" words such as ""surrender"". Mr Johnson replied to Ms Sheriff - who referred to the murder of MP Jo Cox during her intervention - by saying: ""I've never heard such humbug in all my life."" Tracy Brabin, who was elected as MP for Batley and Spen after Mrs Cox was murdered, also urged the prime minister to moderate his language ""so that we will all feel secure when we're going about our jobs"". Mr Johnson replied that ""the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done"". Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the prime minister cannot call an election unless two-thirds of MPs back it, meaning the main opposition party has to back it. But a motion of no confidence in the government only needs a majority of one - and could lead to a general election being held. The government is under no obligation to give time to any call for a motion of confidence from anyone other than the leader of the opposition.   It is unprecedented for the government to voluntarily offer time to the opposition and smaller parties to debate such a motion.   Downing Street said it would assume MPs had confidence in the government and its Brexit strategy if opposition parties did not table a confidence vote later on Wednesday.  A spokesman for the prime minster said: ""It's put up or shut up time."" But the spokesman would not say whether the PM would resign immediately if he lost a confidence vote - or whether a general election would take place if the government was brought down. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox earlier faced questions about the advice he gave the PM indicating the five-week suspension would be within the law. Mr Cox said he respected the Supreme Court's decision, but launched a blistering attack on MPs for being ""too cowardly"" to hold an election, adding: ""This Parliament is dead."" Ms Cherry said Mr Cox was being ""offered up as a fall guy for the government's plans"" and urged him to publish the advice he gave.   "
1,MPs' fury at Boris Johnson's 'dangerous language',"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 22:03:25 GMT","Labour MPs refer to murdered MP Jo Cox as they ask the PM to refrain from using ""offensive"" language.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49833804,"Boris Johnson has refused to moderate his language during a heated debate in the Commons, despite a barrage of criticism from opposition benches. Labour's Paula Sherriff referred to Jo Cox, the MP murdered in 2016, as she pleaded with him to refrain from using ""dangerous"" words like ""surrender"". He described her intervention as ""humbug"" and repeated the word again. The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""a gaping moral vacuum where the office of prime minister used to be"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described scenes in Parliament as an ""absolute bear pit"". Mr Johnson was repeatedly challenged over his use of the word ""surrender"" to describe legislation passed earlier this month which aims to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Ms Sherriff, the Labour MP for Dewsbury, told the Commons the prime minister had ""continually used pejorative language to describe an Act of Parliament passed by this House"". Pointing to a plaque in the chamber, commemorating Mrs Cox, who was murdered by a right-wing extremist, she said:  ""We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like, and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day.""  ""They often quote his words 'Surrender Act', 'betrayal', 'traitor' and I for one am sick of it. ""We must moderate our language, and it has to come from the prime minister first.""

Mrs Cox's husband, Brendan, later tweeted he felt ""sick at Jo's name being used in this way"". The best way to honour her is to ""stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination"", he tweeted. Feel a bit sick at Jo’s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common.

She told MPs: ""I today have reported to the police a threat against my child. That has been dismissed as 'humbug'.

Leader of the Independent Group for Change, Anna Soubry, said it ""takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears"" but she said she is ""not alone tonight"". ""There are others I believe who have left the estate, such has been the distress,"" she told MPs. ""In this, the most peculiar and extraordinary of political times, the language that is used is incredibly important. ""We have evidence, whatever side of the debate you are on, when you use word like 'surrender', 'capitulation', and others use the word 'traitor' and 'treason', there is a direct consequence. ""It means my mother receives a threat to her safety. It means my partner receives a death threat."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the Speaker to unite the party leaders ""to issue a joint declaration opposing any form of abusive language or threats and to put this message out to our entire community that we have to treat each other with respect"". Speaker John Bercow said he was ""very open to convening a meeting of senior colleagues for the purpose of a House-wide public statement"".  Conservative MP Stephen Crabb told BBC Newsnight that he was ""shocked by the way [the PM] responded to the remarks about Jo Cox"". He said Mr Johnson had ""strong support among Conservative MPs... but he also has a duty as prime minister to try to bring unity to our country and reduce the level of poison in our politics"".

2,Trump impeachment: Memo confirms president urged Biden inquiry,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:53:54 GMT",The notes show Mr Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49830588,"The Trump administration has released details of a phone conversation in July that has triggered a US impeachment inquiry against the president. According to the notes, Donald Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to look into corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden, Mr Trump's possible rival in next year's presidential election.  Concerns about the call were initially raised by a whistleblower. The Democrats accused Mr Trump of seeking foreign help to smear a rival. Under the US constitution, a president can be impeached for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours"" - a procedure that can lead to removal from office. In July, Mr Trump froze military aid to Ukraine but he has insisted that this was not used to put pressure on the new government in Kiev. Mr Trump discusses with his newly elected Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, the 2016 removal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, according to notes of their 25 July telephone conversation released by the White House. The US president is quoted as saying in the half-hour call: ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair.  ""A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved."" He continues: ""The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution [of Mr Biden's son] and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the [US] Attorney General would be great.  ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."" Mr Zelensky says in response: ""We will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case.""  Thanking Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky says he stayed in Trump Tower in New York City during a previous visit to the US.  On the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. Mr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a board member.  Other Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. Mr Biden last year told a foreign policy event how he threatened to withhold $1bn in aid to Ukraine unless Mr Shokin was removed. No evidence has come to light so far of wrongdoing by the Bidens. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Mr Trump had promised that a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" of the 25 July call would be released. But the details disclosed by the White House on Wednesday morning were notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in. The July call occurred days after Mr Trump directed the US government to withhold about $391m (£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. In the summary of the call, Mr Trump does not tell the Ukrainian president that US aid hinges upon him investigating Mr Biden. But Mr Trump stresses the importance of US financial support, before pressing Mr Zelensky for action on the Democratic candidate. ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,"" Mr Trump says. In one of the most cryptic passages from the call, Mr Trump mentions a ""server"" and CrowdStrike. He asks Mr Zelensky to ""do us a favour"" adding: ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.""  CrowdStrike is a cyber-security firm that was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate the 2016 hack of the party's email server. That cyber-breach led to the leak of numerous emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. CrowdStrike determined a pair of hacking groups with suspected Russian ties was responsible for the hack. Mr Trump has previously questioned why the DNC did not turn over the hacked email server to the FBI, instead of asking CrowdStrike to investigate. The US president told the Associated Press news agency in April 2017 that he had ""heard"" CrowdStrike was ""owned by a very rich Ukranian"". In the phone call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump appears to suggest the DNC server is stored somewhere in Ukraine.  On Wednesday morning at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Mr Trump said it was the ""single greatest witch hunt in American history"".  ""The way you had that built up that call, it was going to be the call from hell,"" said Mr Trump, who is up for re-election in November 2020. ""It turned out to be a nothing call.""  Speaking alongside Mr Trump at the event, Mr Zelensky told reporters: ""You heard that we had a, I think, good phone call.  ""It was normal. We spoke about many things, so I think you read it that nobody pushed me."" ""In other words, no pressure,"" interjected Mr Trump. But California Democrat Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters the phone call shows ""a classic, mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader"". The Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Tuesday threw her weight behind an official impeachment inquiry into the president's actions. A House vote to impeach the president could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Mr Trump from office. Congress' probe focuses partly on whether Trump abused his presidential powers and sought to help his own re-election by seeking the aid of a foreign government to undermine Mr Biden. Mrs Pelosi said such actions would mark a ""betrayal of his oath of office"" and declared: ""No one is above the law."" The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the Director of National Intelligence in August about the Trump-Zelenksy call. A whistleblower from within the US intelligence community had filed a complaint about the matter.  Federal law requires such complaints to be disclosed to Congress, but the Trump administration has so far refused to do so. The US Department of Justice says the whistleblower had heard the information from ""White House officials"", and did not have first-hand knowledge of the call. The department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said on Wednesday it had reviewed a record of the phone call, and determined ""there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was required"".

3,Widnes dog attack: Elayne Stanley named as victim,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:24:27 GMT","Neighbours say Elayne Stanley, 44, was killed in the attack in Widnes, Cheshire, on Tuesday.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-49824186,"A woman has died after she was attacked by two dogs, police have said. Neighbours said mum-of-three Elayne Stanley, 44, was mauled at the house in Graham Road, Widnes, on Tuesday evening. They reported hearing screams from the terrace house before police arrived to find Ms Stanley seriously injured. Cheshire Police said one of the dogs had to be destroyed while the other had been captured and taken to a secure kennel. No arrests have been made. Officers made repeated attempts to capture both animals, the force said. Neighbour Marie Airey said she ""heard screaming"" at the time of the attack.  She heard panicked shouting, she said, and the sound of someone kicking a door. ""Then they put the dogs out the back and... all hell broke loose,"" she said. Others told the BBC that one neighbour had attempted, unsuccessfully, to stop the attack by throwing bricks at the dogs. Ms Airey said another resident had attempted to resuscitate Ms Stanley, said to be a mother to three girls, including twins. Dorothy Woodward, who also lives on the road, described Ms Stanley as ""a good woman... a lovely lady"". She said she ""had a little cry"" when it became apparent paramedics would be unable to save her.  Cheshire Police has not confirmed the breed of either dog, but said it believed both lived at the address. Det Insp Ian Whiley said: ""We understand people in the community will be concerned... but I would like to reassure residents that we are doing all that we can to establish the full circumstances of the incident."" The victim's next of kin have been informed, police said."
4,'Seahorse' transgender man loses challenge to be named father,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:26:11 GMT","A court rules Freddy McConnell, who gave birth to a child, must be named ""mother"" on a birth certificate.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49828705,"A transgender man, who has given birth to a child and does not want to be described as ""mother"" on a birth certificate, has lost a legal battle. Freddy McConnell wanted to be registered as ""father"" or ""parent"". But a High Court judge ruled the status of ""mother"" was afforded to a person who carries and gives birth to a baby. He said while Mr McConnell's gender was recognised by law as male, his parental status of ""mother"" derives from the biological role of giving birth. Mr McConnell, a journalist at the Guardian, has told the BBC he plans to appeal against the ruling. During the trial in London, the High Court heard how Mr McConnell was a single parent, who was born a woman but now lived as a man following surgery. He was biologically able to get pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy last year, but had legally become a man by the time of the birth. Mr McConnell's journey to parenthood was documented in a film called Seahorse and included his thoughts and footage of him going through fertility treatment, conception and the birth of his baby boy. When he registered the birth of the child, he was told by a registrar that the law required people who give birth to be registered as mothers, the court heard. Mr McConnell took legal action against the General Register Office, which is responsible for the registration of births and deaths in England and Wales, accusing it of discrimination. He said it breached his human right to respect for private and family life. By Ben Hunte, BBC LGBT correspondent Initial reaction to the judgement has been varied - as well as transphobic comments being shared online, some people in support of the transgender community have also said they think that today's ruling was correct.  Some transgender individuals I have spoken to say they are ""deeply disappointed"" by this ruling, but they are not surprised by it.  Aside from legality, some see this decision as a ""missed opportunity to send a much-needed positive message about transgender identity"".  Legal representatives have told me that they are hopeful that if Freddy does not appeal, other transgender parents will continue with their fight for equality.  The ruling means that transgender people will not be recognised as their trans identities in all areas of their lives; in some circumstances, like this, they will now be forced to ""out"" their birth gender.  A transgender man, whose child calls them ""Dad"", will be listed on the child's birth certificate as their mother. One transgender individual told me that this will cause further anxiety around trans parenting.  Had he been successful, Mr McConnell's son would have become the first person born in England and Wales not to legally have a mother. In his ruling, Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the Family Division of the High Court, said: ""There is a material difference between a person's gender and their status as a parent. ""Being a 'mother', whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth. ""It is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognised in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. ""Whilst that person's gender is 'male', their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of 'mother.'"" Sir Andrew added: ""There would seem to be a pressing need for Government and Parliament to address square-on the question of the status of a trans-male who has become pregnant and given birth to a child.""  Karen Holden, founder of A City Law Firm, who is representing Mr McConnell, said: ""Equality shouldn't have to come at a price, but this case has taken three years, hours of work and manpower, public attention and yet the courts still failed to help this family set out its actual family structure correctly in terms of its legal status. ""A birth certificate will stay with a child for life and it will be factually and legally inaccurate under current rules."""
5,Baby Archie meets Archbishop Tutu,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:35:17 GMT",It is the first time the Duke and Duchess's son has been seen during their 10-day tour of Africa.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49825285,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have introduced their baby son Archie to renowned anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It is the first time the four-month-old has been seen in public on the couple's 10-day tour of Africa. Archie was seen smiling in his mother's arms and was held up on her lap. Prince Harry and Meghan joked about their son's time in front of the cameras as they greeted the archbishop and his daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe. ""He's an old soul,"" said Meghan, while Harry remarked: ""I think he is used to it already."" A Nobel Peace Prize winner for his opposition to apartheid, the archbishop said he was ""thrilled"" by the ""rare privilege and honour"" of meeting the royals. He spent half an hour with the couple and Archie at his Legacy Foundation in Cape Town, based in a centuries-old building which was constructed by enslaved people. The archbishop told the couple: ""It's very heart-warming, let me tell you, very heart-warming to realise that you really, genuinely are caring people."" The couple also posted a video to their official SussexRoyal Instagram account of their arrival at the meeting with the archbishop in Cape Town, with the caption: ""Arch meets Archie!"" Later, the Duchess of Sussex spoke about the excitement and pressures of being a working mother as she met female entrepreneurs in Cape Town. Speaking to them at an event called Ladies Who Launch, she said looking after Archie as well as carrying out royal duties was ""a lot"" but added: ""It's all so exciting."" She described one non-profit group, which employs disadvantaged women to make bracelets for good causes, as ""fascinating"". ""By empowering these women from those backgrounds they are changing the focus of their communities and empowering the next generation,"" she said. Meghan also met mothers and young children at mothers2mothers, a non-profit organisation which provides support for pregnant women and new mothers living with HIV. She played with toddlers on the floor and invited other mothers to join her. Some of the children could end up wearing royal hand-me-downs after the duchess handed over two bags of ""loved but outgrown"" clothes as she left. She told the women: ""It's so important we're able to share what's worked for our family and know that you're all in this together with each other. So we wanted to share something from our home to yours."" On their tour so far, the duke and duchess have also visited South Africa's oldest mosque and visited a charity which provides mental health support for young people. Meghan told teenage girls in a deprived part of South Africa she was visiting the country not only as a member of the Royal Family, but also ""as a woman of colour and as your sister""."

7,Climate change: UN panel signals red alert on 'Blue Planet',"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 09:00:09 GMT",A top panel of scientists says the oceans and frozen regions are feeling the heat from rising temperatures as never before.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49817804,"Climate change is devastating our seas and frozen regions as never before, a major new United Nations report warns. According to a UN panel of scientists, waters are rising, the ice is melting, and species are moving habitat due to human activities. And the loss of permanently frozen lands threatens to unleash even more carbon, hastening the decline. There is some guarded hope that the worst impacts can be avoided, with deep and immediate cuts to carbon emissions. This is the third in a series of special reports that have been produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) over the past 12 months.  The scientists previously looked at how the world would cope if temperatures rose by 1.5C by the end of this century. They also reported on how the lands of the Earth would be affected by climate change.  However, this new study, looking at the impact of rising temperatures on our oceans and frozen regions, is perhaps the most worrying and depressing of the three.  In a nutshell, the waters are getting warmer, the world's ice is melting rapidly, and these have implications for almost every living thing on the planet. ""The blue planet is in serious danger right now, suffering many insults from many different directions and it's our fault,"" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, a co-ordinating lead author of the report. The scientists are ""virtually certain"" that the global ocean has now warmed without pause since 1970. The waters have soaked up more than 90% of the extra heat generated by humans over the past decades, and the rate at which it has taken up this heat has doubled since 1993. The seas were once rising mainly due to thermal expansion - which refers to the way the volume of water expands when it is heated. The extra energy makes the water molecules move around more, causing them to take up more space. But the IPCC says rising water levels are now being driven principally by the melting of Greenland and Antarctica.  Thanks to warming, the loss of mass (which refers to the amount of ice that melts and is lost as liquid water) from the Antarctic ice sheet in the years between 2007 and 2016 tripled compared to the 10 years previously.  Greenland saw a doubling of mass loss over the same period. The report expects this to continue throughout the 21st Century and beyond.  For glaciers in areas like the tropical Andes, Central Europe and North Asia, the projections are that they will lose 80% of their ice by 2100 under a high carbon emissions scenario. This will have huge consequences for millions of people. All this extra water gushing down to the seas is driving up average ocean water levels around the world. That will continue over the decades to come.  This new report says that global average sea levels could increase by up to 1.1m by 2100, in the worst warming scenario. This is a rise of 10cm on previous IPCC projections because of the larger ice loss now happening in Antarctica.  ""What surprised me the most is the fact that the highest projected sea level rise has been revised upwards and it is now 1.1 metres,"" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, from the CNRS, France's national science agency. ""This will have widespread consequences for low lying coasts where almost 700 million people live and it is worrying."" On the east coast of England, most of the city of Hull lies below the level of a typical high tide. The sea here can be both a source of wealth and a threat to life.  So the conclusions of the IPCC report have real meaning. A storm surge on a winter's night six years ago found a weak link in a sea wall and flooded businesses and homes.  New defences were ordered and the construction teams are now at work along the shore. But the barriers cannot protect everyone. Computer simulations, developed by the University of Hull, show that if the level of the ocean is one metre higher than now the centre of the city ought to be fine but neighbouring areas will go under.  This highlights a painful question, faced in low-lying places the world over: which should be saved and which should be abandoned as the waters rise?     The report says clearly that some island states are likely to become uninhabitable beyond 2100.  The scientists also say that relocating people away from threatened communities is worth considering ""if safe alternative localities are available"". One of the key messages is the way that the warming of the oceans and cryosphere (the icy bits on land) is part of a chain of poor outcomes that will affect millions of people well into the future.  Under higher emissions scenarios, even wealthy megacities such as New York or Shanghai and large tropical agricultural deltas such as the Mekong will face high or very high risks from sea level rise. The report says that a world with severely increased levels of warm water will in turn give rise to big increases in nasty and dangerous weather events, such as surges from tropical cyclones.  ""Extreme sea level events that are historically rare (once per century in the recent past) are projected to occur frequently (at least once per year) at many locations by 2050,"" the study says, even if future emissions of carbon are cut significantly. ""What we are seeing now is enduring and unprecedented change,"" said Prof Debra Roberts, a co-chair of an IPCC working group II. ""Even if you live in an inland part of the world, the changes in the climate system, drawn in by the very large changes in the ocean and cryosphere are going to impact the way you live your life and the opportunities for sustainable development."" The ways in which you may be affected are vast - flood damage could increase by two or three orders of magnitude. The acidification of the oceans thanks to increased levels of CO2 is threatening corals, to such an extent that even at 1.5C of warming, some 90% will disappear.  When CO2 is dissolved in water it forms carbonic acid. So, the more carbon dioxide that dissolves in our oceans, the more acidic the water gets. Species of fish will move as ocean temperatures rise. Seafood safety could even be compromised because humans could be exposed to increased levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutants in marine plants and animals. These pollutants are released from the same fossil fuel burning that release the climate warming gas CO2. Even our ability to generate electricity will be impaired as warming melts the glaciers, altering the availability of water for hydropower.  Huge amounts of carbon are stored in the permanently frozen regions of the world such as in Siberia and Northern Canada. These are likely to change dramatically, with around 70% of the near surface permafrost set to thaw if emissions continue to rise.  The big worry is that this could free up ""tens to hundreds of billions of tonnes"" of CO2 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100. This would be a significant limitation on our ability to limit global warming in the centuries to come. That's a key question and much depends on what we do in the near term to limit emissions.  However, there are some warnings in the report that some changes may not be easily undone. Data from Antarctica suggests the onset of ""irreversible ice sheet instability"" which could see sea level rise by several metres within centuries.  ""We give this sea level rise information to 2300, and the reason for that is that there is a lot of change locked in, to the ice sheets and the contribution that will have to sea level rise,"" said Dr Nerilie Abram from the Australian National University in Canberra, who's a contributing lead author on the report. ""So even in a scenario where we can reduce greenhouse gases, there are still future sea level rise that people will have to plan for."" There may also be significant and irreversible loses of cultural knowledge through the fact that the fish species that indigenous communities rely on may move to escape warming. Definitely. The report makes a strong play of the fact that the future of our oceans is still in our hands.  The formula is well worn at this stage - deep, rapid cuts in carbon emissions in line with the IPCC report last year that required 45% reductions by 2030.  ""If we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable,"" said Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC. Indeed, some of the scientists involved in the report believe that public pressure on politicians is a crucial part of increasing ambition.  ""After the demonstrations of young people last week, I think they are the best chance for us,,"" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso. ""They are dynamic, they are active I am hopeful they will continue their actions and they will make society change."" Follow Matt on Twitter."
8,Amazon Alexa gets Samuel L Jackson and other celebrity voices,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:18:29 GMT",The firm has also addressed privacy concerns about its smart assistant technology.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49829391,"Amazon has announced that its virtual assistant Alexa will soon be able to mimic the voice of the actor Samuel L Jackson among other celebrities. The firm intends to charge a fee for the feature, with each voice costing $0.99 (80p). The company has also refreshed its range of Echo speakers, adding a larger high-end version with Dolby Atmos for ""3D sound"". Amazon is the world's best-selling smart speaker brand. However, that position is being challenged by Chinese companies including Baidu, while Google is also expected to unveil new gear of its own next month. The company has also extended its Echo range into a selection of wearable tech for both humans and pets for the first time. The new devices include: In addition, the firm said its smart assistant would be built into General Motors' vehicles from next year, and that some existing models could be upgraded to include the feature. ""This avalanche of new products underlines Amazon's desire to extend Alexa's reach to every part of people's lives - be that in the home, or on the move via new Echo Buds or in the car through the deal with General Motors,"" commented Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight. ""Not only will it will strengthen Amazon's reach with existing customers that use Alexa-powered products, it will also provide the opportunity to woo more consumers to embrace its increasingly ubiquitous voice assistant."" Amazon said it would use a ""neural text-to-speech"" engine to mimic celebrities' voices on Alexa-powered devices. It will use recordings the stars provide as the basis for other computer-generated utterances. In the case of Avengers actor Samuel L Jackson, consumers will be given the choice of whether they want a version that swears or not. The firm said other famous stars - who will be paid for their services - will follow. Amazon recently announced it was upgrading its music streaming service to a ""high definition"" format to help its fortunes. Its new Studio speaker should provide users with a means to appreciate the extra detail it offers. Like Sonos' kit, it fine tunes its sound to suit the acoustics of the room it is placed in. And now #Amazon is taking it to the next level with #echostudio and #Dolby #Atmos at $199 hard to see this not being the last nail in the coffin for #HomePod pic.twitter.com/MKPoY5CdHj End of Twitter post  by @caro_milanesi And two of the $200 (£190 in the UK) speakers can be paired and connected to a Fire TV stick or television to create a home theatre experience. ""Amazon has never really had a smart speaker which was marketed specifically for its audio quality, in the manner of an Apple HomePod or a Google Home Max,"" commented Ben Stanton from the tech consultancy Canalys. ""Typically, third-parties like Harman and Sonos would be the ones to differentiate in this space on Amazon's behalf. ""If it [lives up to its promise], it will cannibalise these third-party products, and leave little room left for third-party smart speaker vendors to innovate."" Amazon's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, while shares in Sonos sank 5% lower. Amazon's devices chief Dave Limp addressed users' privacy concerns early on during the launch event at the firm's Seattle headquarters, even showing a tweet it had received complaining about one of its speakers activating without the trigger word ""Alexa"" being uttered. ""We care about this,"" he said. ""Privacy is absolutely foundational to everything we do in and around Alexa."" He highlighted the fact that users can now command a device to delete everything they have said that day. In addition, the firm recently added an option to its Alexa app to let users opt out of having their voices transcribed by humans to improve the service's accuracy. However, some of its rivals - including Apple and Google - have gone further by requiring their users to opt in to similar programmes. ""Privacy is a huge issue for all technology manufacturers and recent revelations show that Amazon is vulnerable,"" commented Adam Simon from the market intelligence firm Context. ""All our research shows that it is a major concern to consumers. ""Yet, ironically, it is not the most important barrier preventing people buying smart home products. Privacy is far outweighed by lack of understanding, lack of perception of value, and lack of good use cases."" He added that later this year, users will be able to ask Alexa ""why did you do that?"", to question it about unexpected behaviour. Furthermore, a new setting will allow them to set recordings to be auto-deleted after a set period of time ranging from three to 18 months. Other announcements included a new 8in (20.3cm) Echo Show smart display, which can now show group video calls with several people on-screen at once. It features the same ""high definition"" screen resolution as the 10in model, but only a one megapixel camera versus the 5MP sensor in the larger device. That means it will likely never add the kind of auto-framing feature that Facebook's Portal and Google Nest Hub Max video chat devices offer, which is achieved by cropping into the image. Other new kit included: Alexa Flex very interesting. Most interesting announce so far. What Nvidia Spot was supposed to be. Small speaker, USB port on bottom and optional smart motion sensor and nighlight. Amazon will sell a ton of these  #AskAlexa pic.twitter.com/qx84ZfM1g0 End of Twitter post  by @PatrickMoorhead Mr Limp also announced changes to its Ring-branded smart doorbells. These will now gain use of Alexa, including a service that will allow visitors to record a message if the owner is out and unable to answer remotely via the device's app. He also unveiled new Ring hardware including a security camera for inside the home - which will compete against Google's Nest Cam as well as similar products from Hive and Canary - and a ""retrofit"" kit that adds smart features to existing alarm systems."

A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation's Executive Complaints Unit [ECU] had ruled that ""while Ms Munchetty was entitled to give a personal response to the phrase 'go back to your own country' as it was rooted in her own experience, overall her comments went beyond what the guidelines allow for"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast on 17 July after Mr Trump's online remarks, Munchetty said: ""Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism. ""Now I'm not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean."" Munchetty said she felt ""absolutely furious"" and suggested many people in the UK might feel the same way. ""I can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious that a man in that position feels it's okay to skirt the lines with using language like that,"" she told co-presenter Dan Walker. Her comments followed Mr Trump posting several messages that made references to the Democrat politicians Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib. ""Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,"" he wrote on Twitter on 14 July. Some BBC journalists tweeted their disapproval at the ECU's ruling. Presenter Carrie Gracie, who resigned her post as China Editor in a dispute over equal pay, said it had caused ""unease"" among BBC journalists ""for whom 'go back' = racist"" and called on the ECU to explain its decision. #nagamunchetty Unease among #BBC journalists for whom ‘go back’ = racist.

11,Thomas Cook collapse: German company files for bankruptcy,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 16:01:09 GMT","After the UK parent company's collapse, the German subsidiary tries to save its national brands.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-49824427,"Thomas Cook's German subsidiary has announced it is filing for insolvency in an attempt to save its national brands after the collapse of the UK parent company on Monday. Almost 100,000 holidaymakers are travelling with the German affiliates and it is not clear what the bankruptcy proceedings will mean for them. The German government has already granted a €380m (£335m; $420m) bridging loan to the holiday airline Condor. Condor is 49% owned by Thomas Cook. The central state of Hesse, where Condor is based, also stepped in to rescue the airline, arguing that it was profitable.  The company said it was ""operationally healthy"" and the six-month loan was aimed at preventing any ""bottlenecks"" resulting from its British parent company. The funding will be paid out pending an agreement with the European Commission. Thomas Cook Germany is also based in Hesse and state premier Volker Bouffier said it was in principle willing to step in to help that company too. It said that it had long been burdened by the weak Thomas Cook business in Great Britain and by Brexit. A total of 600,00 holidaymakers have been caught up in the collapse of the UK company. Many have travelled from the UK but Thomas Cook's empire stretches across Europe and tens of thousands have travelled with its subsidiaries. Under EU package holiday rules, holidaymakers are protected financially from a company's insolvency as well as having the right to repatriation. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has had the task of bringing back more than 150,000 holidaymakers. It repatriated more than 14,000 passengers on Tuesday and was expecting to bring back another 16,500 on Wednesday. Thousands of Dutch, Belgian and Polish tourists are still abroad, but the biggest group affected outside the UK is from Germany. A spokeswoman said on Wednesday that 97,000 people were currently travelling with the company. Thomas Cook Germany employs some 2,000 people and has several national brands, including Neckermann, Öger Tours, Air Marin and Bucher Reisen. A thousand people are employed by the company near Frankfurt. It said it was talking to the German foreign ministry as well as the travel bankruptcy insurer, Zurich, about repatriating customers. Like Condor, it has asked the Hesse state government and the federal government for a bridging loan. The German subsidiary believes its brands have a future and is in negotiations with investors and hotel operators to continue in business. Thomas Cook GmbH said it had been forced to seek insolvency to extricate itself from its (UK) parent company's ""financial tie-ups and related liabilities"". “We didn’t know what to do” The view from one #Majorca hotel, which tried to get #ThomasCook customers to pick up the hotel bill that #ThomasCook failed to payOwner of family business Hotel Morè Juana Crespi told us the hotel is owed €300,000 in unpaid bills from the company pic.twitter.com/kUDQNT3YVW End of Twitter post  by @GavinLeeBBC ""We owe this to our long-standing customers, committed employees and other partners who have supported us so much over the years and in the last difficult weeks,"" said chief executive Stefanie Berk. Thomas Cook businesses in several other European countries are also trying to survive: Founded in 1841, parent company Thomas Cook filed for bankruptcy after failing to secure emergency funding of £200m from the UK government. In the UK, anyone who has bought a package holiday covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol) will have the cost refunded. However, some customers whose future holidays have been cancelled have seen the price of replacement deals spiral. There is also concern that local businesses will be badly affected in countries where Thomas Cook operates:"
12,Juul boss Kevin Burns steps down amid vaping concerns,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:31:09 GMT",The e-cigarette firm will pull all US advertising as chief executive Kevin Burns steps down.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49826732,"Kevin Burns, chief executive of vaping firm Juul, has stepped down, amid growing concerns around vaping health risks and criticism of its marketing. The firm has also announced it will withdraw all US advertising. Mr Burns will be replaced immediately by KC Crosthwaite, former chief growth officer at tobacco giant Altria, Juul said. Juul is 35%-owned by Altria, and in the past has been accused of targeting vaping devices at children. Mr Burns said: ""Since joining Juul Labs, I have worked non-stop, helping turn a small firm into a worldwide business, so a few weeks ago I decided that now was the right time for me to step down."" At the same time, Altria said its merger talks with fellow cigarette-maker Phillip Morris would not move forward. The changes come as Juul faces serious threats to its once explosive growth.   The Trump administration this month said it was preparing a nationwide ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. Juul is also facing multiple investigations, including into its marketing practices.  Juul has for years promoted its e-cigarettes, which contain addictive nicotine, as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products.  However, the Food and Drug Administration recently warned Juul against making health claims without presenting scientific evidence to authorities for approval.  Juul said it would not lobby against the proposed ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. However, Mr Crosthwaite said he remains committed to making Juul's products available to adult smokers.  ""Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry,"" he said.  The crackdown on Juul, which dominates the US e-cigarette market, follows a spate of serious lung injuries in the US linked to vaping. Health authorities have not blamed the outbreak, in which nine people have died and more than 530 people been taken ill, on any one product.  Most of the patients had a history of using vaping products that contain THC, the chemical in marijuana, they said. However, the injuries have raised alarm, especially in conjunction with surging rates of teen vaping. Two US states, New York and Michigan, have already imposed bans on flavoured e-cigarettes, while Massachusetts has announced a four-month ban on all vaping products.  Walmart last week announced it would stop e-cigarette sales, citing the regulatory uncertainty."

But how about ""crazy"" or even a ""Frankenstein's monster"" with major health problems? That's what the creator of the first ever labrador-poodle crossover says.  In a recent interview on an ABC podcast, Wally Conron says the invention is his ""life's regret"" and he hasn't ""got a clue"" why people are still breeding them today. He's become concerned that an influx of copycat cross-breeds has created health problems for many dogs. ""I opened a Pandora's box"" Wally told ABC, ""I released a Frankenstein"".  ""People are just breeding for the money ... unscrupulous breeders are crossing poodles with inappropriate dogs simply so they can say they were the first to do it."" Wally, who's Australian, created the labradoodle in the late 1980s. It took a letter from a blind lady in Hawaii - whose husband was allergic to long-haired dogs - to spur Wally, then a breeding manager, into action. He decided to create a suitable guide dog for the couple.  After three years of trying to find a solution, in 1989 Wally came up with the idea of ""a dog with the working ability of the Labrador and the coat of the poodle"". But despite his success, he feels regret because the labradoodle became ""a bandwagon"" - and his aim of only breeding healthy pups was not followed by others.  ""I find that the biggest majority [of labradoodles] are either crazy or have a hereditary problem.""  Many owners certainly won't recognise Wally's words, though.  For Martha Watton, 20, labradoodles like Barney are the dream dog.  ""He has the perfect mix of lovingness, intelligence and everything. When I'm feeling down or stressed, he picks me up, comes for a cuddle and I feel better again,"" Martha told Radio 1 Newsbeat. She adds Barney is ""the perfect companion for anyone of any age"". ""My grandad has dementia and we take Barney to see him at the care home and he's the perfect calm dog to have around - he doesn't bark.""    What a beautiful place to be with friends.

""I don't think they're particularly crazy, they do seem to make good family pets, I don't think I've ever met one that was vicious or injured a family member."" But if you do have a particularly boisterous pooch, John says there are things you can do. What if they won't stop barking? As annoying as it may be, don't tell them off because they'll become ""the centre of attention"". ""Take the dog away to a quiet area, leave it for 10 minutes and then let it out."" He also advises you to channel your inner zen to avoid your dog doing laps of the house. ""When you get home, you're obviously happy to see your dog and they're happy to see you. But if you immediately go and greet the dog and you're excited, you reinforce that it's an exciting time."" ""Just make a tea and once the dog has calmed down, only then say hello.""

Overdale Infant School in Knighton, Leicestershire, decided to make the change because pupils felt ""overloaded"" by bright, garish colours.  The school believes the new decor, which it describes as like ""grandma's living room"", will improve behaviour. A colour expert said the furniture could give pupils a ""blank canvas"".  Headteacher Hayley Holmes said the school had trialled duller colours like brown and beige last year, and it had a positive impact on pupils' behaviour. She said: ""Children and adults have none of that sensory overload and can feel really calm here. ""Some of the children felt overloaded and found the classroom to be a really difficult place to be in. ""So we're reducing that sensory overload and we're encouraging the children and giving them time to develop."" Karen Haller, an expert of applied colour psychology, said colours were processed by the brain in the hypothalmus. She added: ""When we take in colour we have an emotional reaction.  ""Colour that's stimulating - like red - turns the emotional dial up. ""When you put in colours that are low in saturation, you're turning the emotional dial down. ""You can have a more calming, more restful environment."" Conventional toys have also been ditched for objects like colanders, which the school hopes will help pupils develop role play.  One pupil said: ""It just looks nice, and the things in it, all the stuff makes it look wonderful.""  Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Thomas Cook went into administration in the early hours of Monday morning after negotiations to raise fresh funding failed, leaving 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide - including 9,000 in the UK. Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive of the firm, apologised to staff and customers after the collapse. Staff told the BBC how the closure has affected them. Married couple Hayley and Dan worked at Thomas Cook for a combined total of 34 years before they lost the jobs they loved. Dan, 41, a pilot for the firm for 19 years, was told of the collapse by email before the official announcement was made at about 02.00 GMT.  Meanwhile Hayley, 36, a member of the cabin crew for 15 years, was watching the news unfold at home. Hayley, who did not want to give her surname, told the BBC: ""At first, we were devastated at learning the news. ""Now it transpires that it seems to have been a long time coming.  ""I feel let down. I feel like I've been thrown under a bus."" The couple are due £8,000 in wages next Monday, but do not expect to receive them on time. Hayley added: ""It was a good wage between us. Dan had worked overtime, we had a holiday to Florida in May to pay for, now we can't afford it.  ""We have a bit of savings to cover the mortgage, and we are lucky we have family that can help in the short term, but we desperately need to get Dan, the main breadwinner in our house, a new job by Christmas."" The couple from Manchester have two young daughters, aged five and three, to provide for. She added that crew and pilots had been supporting each other with advice on signing on for jobseekers' allowance and help with mortgage and council tax repayments.  ""It's a very real and immediate problem we have - we all have mortgages going out next week that we can't pay for"", she said.  ""I don't think there's a fix within the week. I know a lot of crew have been ringing various organisations and just crying.  I rang my gym earlier on Tuesday to cancel my membership and just cried down the phone to them."" The couple are expecting to receive fact sheets and individual case numbers by post so they can reclaim money owed to them.  The mother of a Thomas Cook entertainment worker based in Cyprus says ""vulnerable"" young staff have been left to fend for themselves. The woman, who did not wish to identify herself or her daughter, told the BBC that she had to pay £480 for the 19-year-old to fly back to the UK. She said: ""There is no one helping the other vulnerable young people who are out in other countries. ""The workers who are left in these countries have been on minimum wages of €500 (£440) per month. They don't have the means to get home."" ""They were put in touch with the British consulate, and were told there is nothing they could do for them because they're not Atol or Abta protected, and that it was up to the company's insurance to get them back home.  ""When she arrived into work yesterday she was told she had to work, even though the company had gone into administration overnight. ""They said they needed everyone who was part of the team to stay until the last Thomas Cook holidaymaker has left. ""Anyone who decided not to stay had to write a letter of resignation."" The woman's daughter was on a six-month contract with the company, and believes she will not be eligible to claim back any lost pay. David Crighton, a Thomas Cook pilot for 20 years, said losing his job had felt ""like a bereavement"". Mr Crighton, from Cheshire, fears he will not be paid his £12,000 salary for this month, saying ""it won't be coming any time soon."" He said: ""I worked pretty much everyday for a month for nothing. I am probably one of the lucky ones because my wife is in full time employment and I could pay my side of the mortgage for six months. ""The human effect of this is outrageous...the small people are going to be the ones that are really struggling. ""The first people to get paid should be the staff."" He said he fears it will now be a ""bun fight"" to get another pilot's role, and may have to factor work abroad into his job search - though he says he needs Thomas Cook to sign his pilot's licence and flying hours for him to do this. He added that some of his fellow crews were still stranded overseas, including one in Las Vegas, and were facing eye-watering prices for seats to fly home on another airline.  The crew in Las Vegas have now been given free flights home by another airline, he said."
25,"England's historic wall paintings at risk, English Heritage warns","Mon, 23 Sep 2019 23:19:58 GMT","English Heritage looks after 77 wall paintings, many of which decorate medieval abbeys and churches.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49798486,"Time is running out to preserve historic wall paintings around England that are at risk of deterioration and decay, English Heritage has warned. The charity looks after 77 of the paintings, many of which decorate medieval abbeys, priories and churches. It said the damp British climate and flawed restoration attempts threatened the artworks, some of which were older than the Sistine Chapel. In an appeal, it said: ""We need the public's help, before time runs out."" Paintings under threat included work at Lullingstone Roman Villa in Eynsford, Kent, and a Victorian gothic decoration at St Mary's Church in the grounds of Studley Royal Park in North Yorkshire. Many depicted religious scenes, including the ""internationally-important"" art at St Mary's Church in Kempley, Gloucestershire, the charity said. Unlike paintings in France and Italy that benefited from a warmer climate, England's damp weather could damage the fragile works. The fact they were fixed to a wall also meant they could not be moved to a suitable place to preserve them. Meanwhile, early 20th Century attempts at restoration had caused ""more harm than good"", English Heritage said. Those practices included the use of soluble nylon to prevent damage, which had caused increased flaking of paint, it explained. An audit to assess the deterioration had begun as had urgent work on those most at risk, it added. These included medieval paintings at Longthorpe Tower in Peterborough, World War One graffiti at Richmond Castle in North Yorkshire, and the Archer Pavilion roof at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, which needed securing. Conservation work included examining layers of paint with imaging techniques and undoing outdated methods of preservation. Launching its appeal, the English Heritage's senior collections conservator Rachel Turnbull said: ""Wall paintings are the most challenging type of art to care for but they offer a precious insight into England's story. ""People of the past have left little traces, glimpses into their everyday lives through richly decorated wall paintings. ""If they are to survive for future generations to enjoy, we need the public's help today to repair their buildings, stabilise their structures and protect them from damp and decay before time runs out."""

28,'The devil's excrement': How did oil become so important?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:05:30 GMT",What would it take to overturn the world's dependency on oil?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49499443,"It was 27 August 1859, and a crucial message had been sent. Entrepreneur Edwin Drake's last financial backer had finally lost patience. Pay off your debts, give up and come home, the message read.  Drake had been hoping to find ""rock oil"", a brownish unrefined ""crude"" oil that sometimes bubbled near the surface of western Pennsylvania. He planned to refine it into kerosene, for lamps - a substitute for increasingly expensive whale oil.  There would also be less useful by-products, such as gasoline, but if he couldn't find a buyer for that he could always pour it away.  The message had been sent, but Drake had not yet received it when his drill bit punctured an underground reservoir full of crude oil under pressure. From 69 ft (21m) beneath the surface, the oil began to rise.  The whales had been saved, and the world was about to change. Just a few miles south and a few years later, came a hint of what lay in store.  When oil was struck at Pithole, Pennsylvania, in 1864, ""there were not 50 inhabitants within half a dozen miles"", according to the New York Times.  A year later, Pithole had at least 10,000 inhabitants, 50 hotels, one of the country's busiest post offices, two telegraph stations and dozens of brothels.   A few men made fortunes, but a real economy is complex and self-sustaining. Pithole was neither, and within another year, it was gone. Its oil boom did not last, but our thirst for the fuel grew and grew. The modern economy is drenched in oil.  50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast. It's the source of more than a third of the world's energy.  That's more than coal, and more than twice as much as nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy sources combined.  Oil and gas together provide a quarter of our electricity, and the raw material for most plastics.  Then there's transport.  Edwin Drake may have questioned who would buy gasoline, but the internal combustion engine was about to give him an answer. From cars to trucks, cargo ships to jet planes, oil-derived fuel still moves us - and stuff - around.  No wonder the price of oil is arguably the most important single price in the world.  In 1973, when some Arab states declared an embargo on sales to several rich nations, prices surged from $3 to $12 a barrel in just six months.  It led to a global slowdown, with US recessions following subsequent price spikes in 1978, 1990, and 2001. Some economists even believe that record high oil prices played an important role in the global recession of 2008, which is conventionally blamed on the banking crisis alone.  As oil goes, so goes the economy.  So why did we become so excruciatingly dependent on the stuff?  Daniel Yergin's magisterial history of oil, The Prize, begins with a dilemma for Winston Churchill.  Churchill was made head of the Royal Navy in 1911.  One of his first decisions was whether the British Empire would meet the challenge of an expansionist Germany with new battleships powered by safe, secure Welsh coal, or by oil from faraway Persia - modern-day Iran.  Why would anyone rely on such an insecure source? Because oil-fired battleships would accelerate more quickly and sustain a higher speed, required fewer men to deal with the fuel and would have more capacity for guns and ammunition.  Oil was simply a better fuel than coal.  Churchill's ""fateful plunge"" in April 1912 reflected the same logic that has governed our dependence on oil - and shaped global politics - ever since.   After Churchill's decision, the British Treasury bought a majority stake in the Anglo-Persian oil company - the ancestor of BP.  In 1951, it was nationalised by the government of Iran. Our company, protested the British. Our oil, responded the Iranians. The argument would be repeated around the world over the subsequent decades.  Some countries did well. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest on the planet, thanks to its large oil reserves. Its state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, is worth more than Apple or Google or Amazon.   Still, nobody would mistake Saudi Arabia for a complex, sophisticated economy such as that of Japan or Germany. It's perhaps a bit more like Pithole on a grander scale.  Elsewhere, from Iraq to Iran, Venezuela to Nigeria, few oil-rich countries have prospered from the discovery. Economists call it the ""curse of oil"".   Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo, Venezuela's oil minister in the early 1960s, had a more vivid description. ""It is the devil's excrement,"" he declared in 1975. ""We are drowning in the devil's excrement.""   Why is it a problem to have lots of oil?  Exporting it pushes up the value of your currency - which can make everything other than oil prohibitively expensive to produce at home.  That means it can be hard to develop manufacturing or complex service industries.  Historically, many politicians have tried to monopolise their country's oil for themselves and their allies. Dictatorships are not uncommon. There is money - for some - but such economies tend to be thin and brittle.  That's one reason we might hope for something to replace oil. Climate change, obviously, is another.  But oil has so far stubbornly resisted giving way to batteries. This is because machines that move around need to carry their own source of power with them - the lighter the better.  A kilogram of petrol stores as much energy as 60kg of batteries, and has the convenient property of disappearing after use. Empty batteries, alas, are just as heavy as full ones.  Electric cars are finally starting to break through. Electric jumbo jets are a tougher challenge. There was a time when it seemed as though oil might simply start to run out - ""peak oil"" was the phrase - pushing prices ever higher, and giving us the impetus to move to a clean, renewable economy.  In fact, oil is being discovered far more quickly than it is being consumed.  This is partly thanks to the rapid growth of hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking"", a controversial process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped underground under high pressure to release oil and gas.  Fracking is more like manufacturing than traditional exploration and production.  It's standardised, enjoying rapid productivity gains and the process starts and stops depending on whether the price is right.   Many critics have expressed fears about its potential long-term environmental consequences. However, the Permian Basin - home of the US fracking industry - already produces more oil than the 14 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) group, apart from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.   It seems we are still drowning in the Devil's Excrement, and may continue to do so for some time.

29,'I've mapped child murders since my stepfather killed two girls',"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 15:13:05 GMT",Sherele Moody's pain drove her to begin counting the murders of women and children in Australia.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-48591402,"Sherele Moody is no stranger to violence. In addition to spending her spare time documenting the violent deaths of Australian women and children, she has an intense personal experience of it. From a young age, she was subjected to years of violent abuse by her mother. Each time her mother hurt her, she'd run away - before eventually being returned by welfare authorities.   But her most intense experience, one that has shaped her life since, happened to a young girl she had never met. In 1990, Ms Moody's stepfather abducted, raped and murdered nine-year-old Stacey-Ann Tracy, then dumped her body in a creek in a rubbish bag.  Ms Moody was just 18 when Barry Hadlow killed Stacey-Ann in rural Queensland, and recalls vividly events which happened afterwards.  The teenager had just returned to her mother's home because her younger sister, Karen, said she was having a tough time. ""I left my job and came straight back to ensure she was ok,"" she says. Her stepfather picked her up and, on the drive back to the family home, was telling her how a young girl had gone missing from the area.  ""He seemed excited to be joining the search the next day,"" she says. ""I remember him putting his State Emergency Service volunteer uniform on and heading off."" The next thing she remembers is several loud bangs on the door and feeling ""gobsmacked"" to see police stream in and search the house.    She went on to become witness for the Crown against her stepfather. Her mother, Leonie, stayed with and defended Hadlow - whom she had married when Ms Moody was 15. ""She was his biggest backer in court. It was sad to watch,"" Ms Moody says. Ms Moody even attended Stacey-Ann's funeral. ""I can still feel the horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing my stepfather did this - and mum was standing by him,"" she says. Another shock was in store: this wasn't the first time her stepfather had killed. Police informed Ms Moody that, 27 years earlier, he had abducted and murdered a five-year-old girl, Sandra Bacon. Her body was wrapped in a corn sack and left in a car boot. Hadlow had lived near each of his victims and was on parole when he murdered Stacey-Ann. ""The system gave him an opportunity when it shouldn't have,"" Ms Moody says. Ms Moody's mother ""never wavered"" in her support of Hadlow, leading to an estrangement: ""I felt betrayed by her. She brought into the house a killer who'd abducted a girl the same age as my twin sisters."" Now 48, Ms Moody hasn't seen her mother since she was 21. Hadlow died in prison in 2007.  Ms Moody says she ""went off the rails"" and was ""not living a very good life"" after Hadlow's arrest, but later found purpose by completing her schooling and becoming a journalist. ""My entire adult life, I've lived with the guilt of him killing Stacey-Ann,"" she says. ""Not a day goes by I don't think about her.""    In recent years, her guilt morphed into anger. She knew she needed to do something in her spare time to funnel it, which is how the Australian Femicide and Child Death Map was born.  Using Google Maps, Ms Moody is documenting every violent death of women and children in Australia, so far dating back to the 1800s. She uses the skills from her day job as a journalist to memorialise these women and children, so they're no longer just grim statistics.  ""It upset me that Stacey-Ann's death wouldn't be remembered after her family and people like me moved on,"" she says.  ""Every country commemorates its soldiers but not those who die of violence. I wanted to document the true extent, impact and gendered nature of violence on our communities. The fact is, whether you're a man, woman or child, you're most likely to be killed by a man.  ""We can use their stories to make change moving forward, in particular about male violence - by addressing the attitudes towards women that drive it.""  On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner in Australia, according to the most recent Australian Institute of Criminology statistics. Each heart on the interactive map clicks through to a story of a violent death, containing original research from Ms Moody, based on newspaper archives, coroner's reports and appeal judgements. It features tales of neglect, family and domestic violence and stranger violence. Details of what happened to the perpetrator are included. A voice is given to the victim's family, where possible. The very first death Ms Moody documented on the map was her stepfather's murder of Stacey-Ann Tracy. She has since documented 1,880 violent deaths - spending about an hour on each one - all in her own time. Many violent perpetrators get off lightly, Ms Moody says: ""Sentencing is often abysmal. I just mapped the death of a woman stabbed 40 times by a man. He got out within six months. He's out now, enjoying his life. She's another heart on my femicide map.""  As an adult, Ms Moody asked for her file which had been kept by welfare authorities. It was fat with stories of abuse, neglect and violence. Her personal experience fosters a deep connection to each story: ""I hold every one of these women in my heart.""     The femicide map is part of The Red Heart Campaign, which Ms Moody began in 2015 after reporting an ""overwhelming"" number of domestic violence stories. The campaign was originally a story-telling platform and has since morphed into a recording platform for violence against women and children.    It has been viewed 500,000 times in less than 12 months. Not everyone has responded well; Ms Moody regularly receives death and rape threats. It's not just online trolling. In September, her horse was killed - its neck had been broken. Before that, her dog was poisoned so badly, it melted away his mouth, tongue and oesophagus.  Police are investigating both incidents, with potential links to four threats from men who live nearby.  ""These men want the map removed - because it shows the extent that violence is gendered,"" she says. More positive recognition came in June when Ms Moody was shortlisted in Australia's top journalism awards, The Walkleys, for her innovative work using Google Maps. ""It's a pretty thankless task, so that recognition was awesome,"" she says.       Some names in this piece have been changed to protect identities.

30,Private schools: Is Jeremy Corbyn right about bans?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:19:44 GMT",The Labour leader said school fees were banned in some countries.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49825925,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""In some countries, it is not allowed to charge for education in any form... in Finland, for example."" He was defending his party's decision to vote to integrate private schools into the state sector, if Labour won power. So, is he right about Finland? It's true schools there have not been allowed to charge fees for almost 50 years.  The Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture says: ""Charging tuition in basic education is prohibited by the Finnish constitution."" Until the early 1970s in Finland, most secondary schools were run by private organisations. They were gradually brought under public control over the course of the decade, as part of wide-reaching educational changes, and their governing bodies were abolished.  Schools not operated by the government or local authorities are permitted - and are referred to as ""private schools""-  but they are publicly funded and free to pupils, although some charge parents and guardians registration fees.  And there are only 75 of them, making up just 2% of Finnish schools.  This doesn't mean all forms of paid-for education, including private tuition, are banned. But no-one can charge for mainstream schooling that leads to a formal qualification.    Finland is rare in the world for having a model like this - we weren't able to find another country with the same rules. It has been held up as an example because the country scores so highly on the internationally recognised Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) for science, mathematics and reading. Its 15-year-olds out-perform those in countries that do have private schools - although we can't say the lack of private schools itself is the reason.  The country also performs well for educational equality - that is, pupils have an equal chance of doing well at school regardless of their background.  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which runs the Pisa testing, says of Finland: ""No other country has so little variation in outcomes between schools - and the gap within schools between the top and bottom-achieving students is extraordinarily modest as well.  ""Finnish schools seem to serve all students well, regardless of family background or socio-economic status."" A lack of fee-paying schools is not the only difference between the Finnish and other European models of education, though, says Prof Pasi Sahlberg,  who has acted as an ambassador for the Finnish model around the world. Pupils start school at the age of seven after funded early childhood education that focuses on play.  Teachers are paid better than they are in the UK, undergo much longer training courses, and have greater flexibility and control over what they teach.  ""The main issue in Finland is not just absence of private schools but having education policy that protects education as a basic human right and public service,"" Prof Sahlberg says. Finland also has a different demographic mix to the UK, with a far smaller and less diverse population, meaning issues around the funding and organisation of education are not necessarily comparable.

31,Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 06:17:52 GMT",It's gone from Boris Buses to expected administration - BBC News NI looks at the firm's history.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-49801334,"In 2012, Wrightbus was riding high. The company launched a new red double decker bus for London. A fleet of the New Routemasters had been ordered by the then mayor Boris Johnson - and so became known as Boris Buses.   The new bus even had a starring role on Top Gear, racing with supercars. It was a triumphant time for the Ballymena business, but now it's been brought low, set to fall into into administration. The company's financial stress became public knowledge in July. It admitted it was working with business advisors Deloitte to find potential investors. This confirmed months of rumours that had been swirling around Ballymena. The first sign of problems could be seen in the firm's most recently-published accounts. The top company in the Wright business, the Cornerstone Group, showed the firm made a loss of £1.7m in 2017. That compared to a pre-tax profit of almost £11m in 2016. A note in the accounts said there was continued uncertainty in the UK market with a ""challenging outlook"" for all bus manufacturers. It also said the business was facing increased material prices due to exchange rates. That is a reference to the relative weakness of sterling since the Brexit vote, which makes it more expensive to buy components that are priced in euros or dollars. The company's financial position has deteriorated further since then. Wrightbus is a major employer in Ballymena with more than 1,200 employees. It can trace its history to the years after World War Two, when Robert Wright began making body work for vans and other vehicles. He was joined by his son William who was instrumental in transforming the business into a major bus builder. It broke into the UK market and then, under former chief executive Mark Nodder, grew its international presence. Buses were made for customers in Hong Kong and Singapore. A joint venture was set up in India. Just two years ago, the company moved onto a huge manufacturing site in Ballymena. It had been vacated by the cigarette company JTI when they pulled out of the County Antrim town. It was statement of intent by Wrightbus: ""We're growing and we're here to stay."" Demand for new buses in the UK, the key market for Wrightbus, is weak. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that in the second quarter of this year new bus and coach registrations are down 30% compared to the same period last year. That marks the 10th quarter in a row that new registrations have declined. The bus market is cyclical and Wrights did benefit from a splurge of bus buying earlier this decade as operators updated their fleets to meet new regulatory requirements. But this down part of the cycle seems particularly pronounced. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""The current climate of political and economic uncertainty, exacerbated by confusion around differing local authority requirements for clean air zones, is affecting operators' confidence and willingness to invest in the market."" And for all its publicity the Boris Bus did not land any export sales for Wrightbus. Transport for London also stopped ordering it in 2016 as it fell out of favour with the the new mayor Sadiq Khan. Wrightbus's efforts to break into international markets have also not been enough to compensate for weakness in the UK. In recent years the company has paid out large donations to a religious charity, Green Pastures, which is led by Wrightbus's majority shareholder Jeff Wright.  Green Pastures received about £15m over six years, helping it to develop a huge church and village complex known as Project Gateway. Most of this money was paid at a time when the company was making large profits. Work at the Gateway site appears to have stalled in recent months. Wrightbus has developed expertise in electric and hydrogen-powered buses and these are expected to be a growing part of the market  So there's still some hope that something can be salvaged from this failure."

33,We Are Stoke-on-Trent: How ceramics power your car and phone,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 23:29:50 GMT",Stoke-on-Trent has always been known for its ceramics. But is it still all about the tableware?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-49641133,"Ceramics are everywhere - not just on your table but in your car engine, your mobile phone and your wi-fi. Though Stoke-on-Trent's ceramics industry has suffered a decline, new research and development could be starting to push The Potteries wheel forwards again. ""Most people do not realise what ceramics can be used for,"" said Tony Kinsella, chief executive of development firm Lucideon. ""They are fundamental to our way of life. For instance a mobile phone, a smartphone - up to 600 of its components are ceramic."" Tens of thousands were employed in the city's pottery industry during its heyday. And if they weren't working in factories, many were also employed in the supply chain - as miners, canal workers, crate packers and mechanics. Today, the fear is younger generations have no connection to the city's pottery heritage. Dr Natalie Armitage said she has noticed children, who once would have known family members in the industry, have no links to it at all. She, along with others who work for the British Ceramics Biennial (a contemporary ceramics festival held in the city), are working to make sure this connection does not get lost. Students are brought to the old Spode factory where they have the chance to learn about the city's heritage, get their hands dirty in clay and discover what the future might hold. ""We talk about 3D printing, for example, and how we can use it in different ways. They are always interested in the technology,"" she said. ""There's an interactive space so they can think about the material through sounds, light and mirrors - it's all about changing the perception of the clay and how can we challenge them and get them to think differently. ""I always start by asking if they know how many ceramic components there are to a mobile phone? That always gets everyone thinking."" Ceramics is an area that is rich in innovation, Dr Armitage said. ""There is the potential for young people to take it on in new and interesting ways. It won't be in the traditional ways, it will be in ways we can't even conceive of yet."" The 240 scientists at Lucideon, which started life more than 100 years ago as the British Ceramics Research Association, are working in some seriously hi-tech industries. Here they are developing ways of using sodium-based batteries instead of lithium to reduce environmental damage, looking at the use of ceramics within painkillers to reduce potential dependency on opioids and looking at new ways of applying heat management to engines - again to be more environmentally friendly - in the aerospace industry. Dr Mark Cresswell, 34, a senior scientist in healthcare at Lucideon, is from Stoke-on-Trent. ""I was aware of the city's history when growing up,"" he said. ""It is taught in school. But I never saw myself as being involved in the industry in that traditional way, but then I didn't know how much we could do in ceramics. ""We are still working with ceramics in the traditional sense but there is so much more to it."" He thinks there is no reason why Stoke-on-Trent cannot be a force in the future. ""Anyone who works in the industry is aware there is a perception of what ceramics is, so we are speaking to clients all the time to raise awareness of developments."" Pauline Dawson began work aged 15 at Copelands, which later became Spode, after first getting a scholarship to art school to do ceramic painting. Now 82, she does demonstrations for visitors. ""I didn't know anything about potbanks (pottery factories). It [painting] was a hobby for me, I didn't know I would be able to do it for a living. ""It was a rude awakening. There was 1,000 people worked there. When the bell rang there would be a kind of thundering sound as everyone ran to clock off. It was very frightening for a 15-year-old. ""At first I was on the top floor with Miss Trimble. She was a very nice lady but strict, she had to be with 50 of us.  ""We were sat on three-legged stools from 8am to 5.30pm, with a 10-minute break in the morning and an hour for lunch. I thought it was terrible. But I enjoyed the painting and they let me go to art school on Wednesday afternoons. ""Later, I went to the bob shops where where we painted the china. It was piecework and I got a lot of money because I was quite fast. But for every £1 you earned they deducted two shillings to pay for your apprenticeship. ""Eventually, we ended up painting pieces to celebrate Princess Margaret's wedding and we had to swear on the Bible we would not tell anyone what we were doing. ""I do wish it [the industry] would all start up again. I really think we have lost some of the quality we had because it is cheaper to import from abroad."" While some firms develop and further the use of ceramics, others are looking at how traditional skills can be retained. Neil Brownsword worked as an apprentice modeller at Wedgwood, in Barlaston, in the late 1980s. Now he is head of ceramics at Staffordshire University and is keen the old traditions of pottery making, such as copper plate engraving, china flower making and mould making are retained. ""China flower making (where flowers are made and modelled out of clay), it's an incredible craft skill,"" he said. ""It could be made viable again with some creative thinking. ""I think ceramics are becoming fashionable again - the younger generation seem to be turning back to it. We have to use the past as well as the future - use the technological advances."" And some businesses are prospering. A lot of the outsourcing is now being brought back in house and anything stamped made in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire or England is still a draw. ""There is still a demand for high quality wares,"" said Miranda Goodby, curator at The Pottteries Museum and Art Gallery. ""Steelite has really capitalised on the hospitality trade, while Emma Bridgewater brought her studios to the city 30 years ago and is a great success. Portmeirion also decamped to the city. Other smaller companies have moved here for the clay and the raw materials, it is still all being done in Stoke-on-Trent. ""The city has got a real buzz. It's all got very hi-tech and it's remarkable."" While acknowledging the city's heritage, Mr Kinsella and others are determined to drive the area and its industry forwards. ""I feel sad looking at the old buildings and the industrial wasteland in the city,"" he said. ""But we can't make Stoke-on-Trent into a museum - we need to build on its heritage, not live in the past."" The next step could be the creation of an advanced ceramic campus where, it is hoped, some of the best universities will be attracted to help develop ever newer uses and techniques. ""We have a possible site, some investors but we need money from the government - about £40m,"" Mr Kinsella said. ""If we can get the support I think we are three years away from making a significant impact in the city.""

34,The Apprentice: How does the show stay fresh after 15 years?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 01:00:44 GMT",Lord Sugar discusses coming up with new tasks for the candidates and how he wants to reach 20 series.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49789363,"Desperate Housewives, Strictly Come Dancing, Lost, Entourage, House and Peppa Pig might not look like they have much in common, but all were launched in the same year - 2004.  It was, safe to say, a significant year for television.  And in addition to the US dramas, TV talent shows and preschool pigs, 2004 also happened to be the year a business show called The Apprentice began. ""Some of this year's [candidates] were five years old when we first started this programme,"" points out Lord Sugar ahead of the show's 15th series. ""Youngsters I speak to every day of the week who stop me in the street love the programme and say they're inspired by it."" The Apprentice was an immediate success upon its launch in the US and the format was swiftly exported around the world. The UK series, which aired on BBC Two in February 2005, was promoted to BBC One after just two years because it was so popular, and the American version itself even produced a future president. But while Lord Sugar sees no need to hang up his tie any time soon, the 72-year-old acknowledges it can't go on forever. ""I've got one more series [after this one] that I'm contracted for, which will be the 16th series,"" he says. ""I might do it to 20. Twenty sounds like a round figure."" In 2010, the prize changed from a job in Lord Sugar's company to a £250,000 investment in the winning candidate's business idea. But beyond that, the format has broadly remained the same - 16 candidates, split equally in gender, competing in a series of challenges, with one being fired at the end of each weekly task. ""This raw and painful familiarity must be why The Apprentice continues to be so popular,"" wrote Lucy Sweet in The Big Issue last year. ""Despite never changing an iota of its format, it's still rumbling on."" Stuart Heritage of The Guardian, meanwhile, has written an article calling for the show to be cancelled every year for the last five series. ""The Apprentice, despite being roughly as enjoyable as getting pelted with sun-hardened donkey dung, inexplicably remains a thing,"" he said last year. But the stars of the show argue that the format is kept fresh thanks to the new tasks which are added every year, often reflecting changes in technology. ""They're right up to-date, last year it was robotics,"" says Lord Sugar. ""This year, they have to be music agents,"" picks up Baroness Karren Brady, ""and represent an emerging artist and sell his music. There's an electric bike [task], there's a toy... they design a rollercoaster."" And coming up with the ideas for tasks is harder than it looks, argues Lord Sugar, because ""one has to think of the logistics of a TV programme"".  ""In the early days, I thought of one task that I put to the production team of becoming a city trader - buying and selling shares and all that type of stuff. But the truth of the matter is that would make a very boring film. And there are other tasks that would be similar. So I think what we've got at the moment are tasks that have a physical element to them. ""Having the candidates making stuff in the kitchen is always interesting. One of my favourite tasks is buying the eight items and negotiating. So I do believe the physical side of things is important."" He adds: ""The production company's team spend months researching and dreaming up these ideas and not only that, but also having to get partners to co-operate. To allow us to come into their venues, to go on their trains, to play with their equipment. ""Don't underestimate the amount of work that goes into that, the paperwork, it takes a lot of organising. The London borough of Islington, for example, doesn't allow you to put a camera on their streets unless you ask permission, all that stuff has got to be cleared."" Perhaps the most significant change for the show over the last 15 years is the changing landscape of television itself.  In 2004, BBC iPlayer didn't exist. The public largely watched TV programmes live, in their allotted timeslot. As a result, the viewing figures broadcasters received the next morning could make or break a show. But, Lord Sugar says: ""The figures that people quote of overnights now are all meaningless, because you have to add the iPlayer and the Sky Plus-type user that watches it afterwards, and when you start adding all those together, it comes to 10 million or something like that."" (He's being slightly generous there - the finale of the last series attracted 7.74 million when all platforms are included, according to ratings body Barb. The original overnight figure was 5.86 million, which meant nearly two million used catch-up services to watch.) ""The problem with our programme is the spoiler,"" Lord Sugar continues. ""Because if you really want to follow it, you don't want to know who got fired the next day [if you haven't seen the episode]. So unlike something like Peaky Blinders for example, which you can pick up the day afterwards, you don't really want to pick up The Apprentice the day afterwards unless you cut yourself off from the world.""  One constant of every series of The Apprentice is how self-assured some the contestants are. In fact, this year's crop appear to have finally broken Claude Littner.  ""Normally I'm completely dispassionate,"" he deadpans. ""I watch the candidates day in and day out, and I don't really care. However, this year, I found them incredibly irritating. And as we go through, you'll be irritated as well, I guarantee it."" From the opening seconds of this series, you can see what he means. ""Millions isn't enough for me, I need billions for the lifestyle I want,"" claims one candidate. ""Cut me, and I'll bleed ambition,"" says another. ""We've got a pillow salesman, a librarian, a baker, a sports agent,"" says Baroness Brady of this year's crop of hopefuls. ""There's no mould of a business person now, it's anybody with any kind of background or experience.""  Lord Sugar agrees: ""They are a different group of people, and that's what makes the programme each year, different characters from all walks of life."" The Apprentice begins on Wednesday 2 October at 21:00 BST on BBC One."
35,Brittany Howard finds freedom after Alabama Shakes,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:32:35 GMT",The singer on why she left her band and how her late sister Jaime inspired her first solo record.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49808839,"In the middle of making her new album, Brittany Howard decided to record the air conditioner. Holding a microphone to ceiling, she captured the unit's electromagnetic pulse, turned it into a tape loop, then transposed it onto a keyboard. ""In the end, I think we were overly ambitious,"" she reflects. ""Because it turned out to be terrible."" The experiment may have been scrapped, but it illustrates the sense of freedom Howard felt as she made her first solo album. ""I actually made some music the way I hear it,"" she says. ""No-one tells me they don't like it, no-one says they don't like this bass part, or this arrangement's too crazy. It was just up to me to make my own mistakes."" Howard was last seen as the frontwoman of Alabama Shakes, the roots-rock revivalists who won an armful of Grammys for their debut album, Boys & Girls, and its 2015 follow-up, Sound & Colour. But by the time they finished their most recent tour, in 2017, the singer-songwriter felt drained and exhausted.  Facing 30, she was also considering what another decade in the band might look like.  A lightbulb flickered into life during a long drive through the plains of Oklahoma with her wife, musician Jesse Lafser. ""I thought, 'What do I want for the rest of my career?' And I said, 'Well, it'd be cool if I did something on my own'.  ""I just felt unwilling to give things away any more."" Once she decided to go it alone, the band were the first people she called.  ""We sat in a circle and we just talked about it. It was bittersweet, for sure, because we've grown up together, we've changed our lives together - but I think everyone walked away from the room knowing that it wasn't necessarily so much an ending as it was like, 'OK, here's a new beginning'."" Howard set about writing her debut solo album in Topanga, California, in the middle of a heatwave - playing all the instruments herself in a ""sweaty greenhouse"" no bigger than a double bed. ""Topanga is a really beautiful mountain area with flowers and bees and birds - but I was just absolutely miserable when I first got there, banging my head against the wall going, 'I can't think of any new songs. I can't think of anything, I can't do anything.'  ""But once I stopped trying, the songs came, and they came really complete. I could just hear all the parts."" Freed from the constraints of working with a band, she indulged her wildest musical ideas - mixing decades worth of P-Funk, psychedelic blues, hard rock, Southern soul and gospel with free-wheeling imagination.  In lesser hands it would be a mess, but Howard has a firm grip on song structure, never allowing musical complexity to get in the way of a melody; while her vocals, always the highlight of Alabama Shakes' albums, are typically soulful and nuanced. End of Youtube post  by Brittany Howard - Topic The emotional territory she covers is just as broad and uncompromising. Georgia is an undulating R&B ballad about falling in love with an older woman; while He Loves Me discusses her relationship with God (""I don't go to church any more/I know He still loves me"") over a lurching Benny & The Jets rhythm. Her most striking lyrics come on Goat Head, as she discusses growing up as the child of a poor, interracial couple in rural Alabama.  ""When I was born - or rather when my sister was born in 1984 - that was like the first wave of mixed babies, little brown babies,"" she says.  ""My mama would go around town, pushing my sister and I in a cart to the grocery store, and people would actually come up to her and lecture her. They would say, 'Do you know what you've done?'"" In the song, she recalls an incident that happened when she was a baby, but was told about later, where ""someone cut off a goat's head, and they put it in the back of my dad's car and slashed his tyres, and smeared blood all over his car"". ""It's always been a part of me, that story,"" says Howard. ""Because Athens was a beautiful, peaceful country place, where people are neighbours and we really care about each other. But there's a racial line, or there was at least, and that's why I wanted to write that song. Just to explain where I was coming from."" She recalls happier childhood experiences on Stay High - an ode to her father, and the joyous nights of games and music he'd instigate when he got home from the ""grind and hustle"" of his day job. ""My family didn't have a lot of money, so music was a free activity,"" she says. ""We could dance or we could sing with it, or we could play on buckets with it."" End of Youtube post  by BrittanyHowardVEVO Her older sister Jaime was her role model, playmate and idol, she recalls. More importantly, she inspired her to play piano. ""She learned by ear and she'd try to play Beethoven pieces and things like that. And I would just sit in this blue chair in my grandmother's living room, and I would turn round and round and round and listen to her play, and I'd go, 'Do it again, do it again'. We could sit with that piano for hours and make it so entertaining."" But Howard's world was torn apart when Jaime died of retinoblastoma, a rare of form of eye cancer, when she was just 13. ""My whole family was devastated,"" she says. ""We had prayed and she didn't make it. It was like, 'How could God do this to a child? How could he do this to our family?'"" They stopped going to church. Howard's parents divorced. And, because the family house had burned down during Jaime's illness, the singer lost almost every trace of her sister. Although her new album isn't about Jaime, it carries her name, ""so it would no longer bring me sadness,"" Howard says. ""She was my first teacher. She was the one who taught me to love music, and who taught me to be imaginative and creative. She left me with all those things I hold near and dear to me, so it only felt appropriate to put her name on there - because I feel like I didn't do it alone."" Just as Jaime was crucial to her musical education, Howard had help in the studio as she fleshed out her album - with jazz drummer Nate Smith, keyboardist Robert Glasper and Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell turning her demos into a full-band affair. ""I'd tell them, 'I want you to stick to the song, but I want you to do it your way. Do what moves you'.  And because they're so emotive, it made the whole process very simple and wonderful."" The adventurous approach didn't stop with the air conditioner - Smith plays the drums with chopsticks on Stay High - and Howard rails against the modern trend for auto-tuned technical perfection. ""You know, you don't need the best gear, the most expensive stuff, to make something wonderful. In fact, it's a lot more fun, being creative with things that are kind of worthless junk,"" she says. The record, which was released last Friday, has already received glowing reviews. Rolling Stone magazine called it ""strikingly bold"" while Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine  said repeated listens would prove ""profound and nourishing"". For Howard, who finished the album last year, it's just a relief to finally get it out there. ""I've been like a chicken with a giant egg,"" she laughs. ""I've been sitting on this forever.""

36,"Less debt, better prospects: Why students work","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:04:21 GMT",Getting work experience can be one of the most valuable aspects of being at college.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49731270,"As a new generation of students settle into university life, many will be prepared for years of hard work - not just studying, but part-time jobs. And for some, the employment can be as educational as the courses.  Work experience certainly helped Hira Hanif overcome a rocky start to start a career that made her and her parents proud. The 29-year-old moved to the UK from Pakistan aged 12, and struggled with her English at school. She got E, F and G grades in her GCSEs, and she failed her A-levels, twice. She didn't have the grades she needed to get to university - and instead had to spend two years sitting a vocational BTEC qualification first. Not wanting to be overburdened with debt, she lived at home and took out minimal government loans. She worked as a sales lead at the shoe shop Aldo - a more demanding role than most student jobs. Partying took a back seat.  Work experience is an integral part of legal training, but her experience was mixed. In her law degree, she says she didn't learn much. ""I was given a book and told to sit at the back of the court and take notes. I was never fully involved [and they never] explained anything, so I never really enjoyed it."" The next level of her studies, the Bar Professional Training Course, was much more informative, she says.  ""I understood more of what was happening in court, and I appreciated my work placements more,"" she says. ""I took every opportunity that I could to sit in court."" Hira completed her law studies this summer and now works as an advocate in Bristol. ""When I left school I made a pact that to say thank you for my parents' hard work and their sacrifice, I am going to do something that will make them proud of me,"" she says. ""I failed so many times and every time they would say, 'That's ok, let's try again'. And that's what got me where I am.""   Work experience can sometimes be a good way to find out more about working life, decide on future careers or study options, and develop skills and employability.  ""Our research has shown that 90% of students are motivated by future employment when working whilst studying,"" says Eva Crossan Jory, vice president, welfare, of the National Union of Students.  Universities and colleges themselves can often help with access to part-time employment, support in moving into work after graduation and work experience, she adds. The careers advice service is the place to start. Few things will impress a potential employer more than a student who sets up their own business - and for many students, that's a career goal in its own right. ""Students are generally more entrepreneurial than 10 years ago - the accessibility provided by modern technology means students have the opportunity to show their entrepreneurial skills more freely and easily,"" says Louise Farrar, PwC's head of student recruitment. For example Hasan Sukkar, 21,  funded his degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Exeter by selling hoodies and pillows online.  ""The world of e-commerce is constantly evolving with new tools, technologies and business models that are challenging the status quo. Setting up an e-commerce business is easier than ever before,"" he said. Hasan also combined his business and full-time studying with a placement year at oil giant ExxonMobil.  ""It helped me in deciding what career I want to have, and it greatly increased my chances of getting accepted into very competitive graduate schemes,"" he said.  After graduating, Hasan was accepted onto the New Entrepreneurs Foundation Fast Track Programme. He is now working as a data scientist.  ""A lot of people go to university not knowing what they are trying to achieve and then leave with tens of thousands of pounds in debt and limited career prospects,"" he said. ""To avoid this, my biggest three suggestions would be to gain relevant work experience from early on in your degree, push yourself outside your zone of comfort and try varied pursuits until you find out what you enjoy the most, and most importantly surround yourself with smart people who will help and support you in becoming the best version of yourself."" In 2018, a Santander report found that a quarter of students run, or plan to run their own company. Student enterprises collectively generate revenues of £1bn a year, and a third plan to turn their business into a career when they graduate. And some universities offer mentorship and support programmes to help budding campus entrepreneurs.  Anglia Ruskin University, for example, runs and academy which offers seminars, networking events, grants, and pitching clinics for students. It also holds an annual competition, where students can develop a business plan and pitch for funding. The scheme allowed Chiyedza Heri to pitch her own business. She was studying Biomedical Science. ""My parents had encouraged me to take the sciences route. Initiatives [like this one] showed me that if other students like me, not studying business, can try out ideas, what's stopping me?"" she says. Chiyedza pitched several ideas, including a research company that would identify herbs used in Zimbabwean medicine and a herbal medicine company. In the end she settled on selling African herbal tea. Although she didn't win the prize money, she had a business plan and valuable experience to use when starting her own company. ""Initially I really focused on the health benefits and the bells and whistles,"" she says. ""Through feedback and mentoring I learnt to tailor a pitch to the audience."" ""Students now appreciate that it doesn't matter what discipline they are studying - they all have the chance of being entrepreneurial. And setting up their own business is no longer a plan, for many it is their main aim,"" says Marcia Baldry, enterprise support manager at the academy.

37,Bangladesh bride walks to groom's home in stand for women's rights,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:35:22 GMT",Khadiza Akter Khushi broke with ancient Bangladeshi tradition to walk to her future husband's home.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49809469,"When 19-year-old Khadiza Akter Khushi led hundreds of people to the home of her soon-to-be husband, she didn't do it for her guests. She did it for all the Bangladeshi women she hoped would follow in her footsteps. The walk is thought to be a first in a country where, for centuries, the opposite has happened: men have walked to the homes of their brides on their wedding day.  ""If boys can bring girls to marriage, why can't girls?"" she asked BBC Bengali in the days after her wedding to Tariqul Islam had gone viral. But it has both inspired and horrified. One man suggested the couple and their families should be beaten with slippers. For Khadiza and her husband it was, quite simply, the right thing to do. ""Tradition is not the issue here,"" she told the BBC. ""It is a matter of women's rights. Today, if a girl goes to marry a boy, then no one is harmed.  ""Instead, abuse of women will decrease, women will get their dignity. No one will be less than the other."" The couple were aware of the resistance to the marriage, held in a rural region next to the border with India last Saturday. Even members of their own families were not initially keen. But Tariqul, 27, says they eventually came around. After all, they were doing nothing wrong. ""Many marry in court, many marry in the mosque. We were married according to religion,"" the newly-wed explained.  ""There was a Kazi [marriage register], witnesses. That's how the marriage was registered. That's the formality of marriage. That's exactly what we did.  ""It doesn't matter what people think, what they say. Some people will think differently, everybody is entitled to their opinion."" by Sanjana Chowdhury, BBC Bengali According to tradition here, the groom and his relatives go to the house of the bride, where the marriage and celebrations will take place, before the bride says goodbye to her family and goes to her husband's house.  It has happened like this since ancient times. But in Meherpur, a district in western Bangladesh, something unique has taken place: here, the bride came with her family to the groom's house to marry, and afterwards the groom moved to the wife's home. The significance of this cannot be understated: for many men, this would be considered humiliating. Some people would even call it outrageous.   This wouldn't even happen in the cities of Bangladesh, let alone a small village. This couple have started out their married life showing great courage. Despite their confidence, it was a brave decision. Bangladesh has made great strides towards equality in recent years, and is the highest ranked country in South Asia when it comes to gender equality, according to the World Economic Forum. But serious issues remain. The death of Nusrat Jahan Rafi - who, at 19, was the same age as the bride - made headlines around the world. She was allegedly burned alive after filing a complaint for sexual harassment against her headmaster. Meanwhile, the United Nations says around two-thirds of women who marry will experience violence at the hands of their partners, with half reporting assaults in the last year.  And while the position of women is improving in areas like education, marriage laws in the Muslim-majority country have been criticised by women's rights groups as restrictive and discriminatory.  It was only last month that the high court ruled that women would no longer be required to declare whether or not they were virgins on marriage registration forms. Men did not have to make any such declaration. Tariqul and Khadija are hopeful their wedding will be another step towards true gender equality. ""I am sure our marriage will send a message that a woman can do whatever a man can,"" Tariqul told news agency AFP. And even if not, they are more than happy with their choice. ""We had a lot of fun in the wedding,"" Khadiza said."
38,Trump Ukraine call: What's this story all about?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 22:39:20 GMT",There's a new political controversy in the US - it's complex but we break it down into bite-sized chunks.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49800181,"There's a new political controversy in the US - involving Donald Trump, foreign nationals, questions about legal and ethical behaviour, and allegations against a political rival - and it's all led to an impeachment inquiry into the US president. The story can be difficult to follow, so here are some answers to the most pressing questions. Mr Trump's critics accuse him of using the powers of the presidency to bully Ukraine into digging up damaging information on a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden. Mr Trump and his supporters allege the former vice-president abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter. Mr Biden is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to take on Mr Trump next year.  In other words, it is nothing less than the White House at stake. Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a phone conversation on 25 July this year.  A rough transcript of the call shows that the US president pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice-President Biden and his son, who was a board member for a company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. The call came after the Trump administration had delayed releasing US military funds to Ukraine until mid-September. Mr Trump also referenced the 2016 hacking of the Democratic email server in the call to Mr Zelensky, and seemed to imply that the server still exists somewhere in Ukraine. The US president says he has done nothing wrong, calling the impeachment proceedings a ""joke"".  He has accused Democrats of themselves threatening Mr Zelensky by withholding their votes on US laws affecting Ukraine, and says the controversy was created in order to distract from Mr Trump's meetings at the United Nations. Congressional Democrats say the phone call - raised by a whistleblower in a formal complaint - is proof Mr Trump brought improper pressure on a foreign power for personal gain.  Democrats say the president wanted the Ukrainians to start the investigation into corruption because this could sully the reputation of Hunter and his father.  Several Republicans came forward after the partial transcript of the call was released to defend Mr Trump. This shows the partisan nature of the controversy, which has - like much else in Washington - been divided by party politics. However, at least one Republican, Mitt Romney, a US senator from Utah, said he would like to know more. If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. End of Twitter post  by @MittRomney We still don't know.  Initial reports painted the complaint as a troubling account of the president's dealings with a foreign leader. For days after details of the complaint emerged the Trump administration refused to share it but amid growing pressure it changed tack. President Trump has now pledged transparency and the release of the phone transcript formed part of this - the president said it would show the call was ""totally appropriate"".  The transcript released though was not a full, verbatim account, but rather notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in. The complaint itself was released to the House and Senate Intelligence committees on Wednesday and reports suggest that negotiations are under way to allow the still unknown whistleblower to testify.  Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, is scheduled to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. The most damning allegation is that the president pressured a foreign leader for damaging information about a political opponent while holding out the prospect of US military aid.  Is that illegal? We do have some very recent precedent. It certainly recalls the recently concluded two-year Robert Mueller investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian election-meddling in 2016.  The special counsel's report detailed multiple contacts between the campaign and Russian nationals, including the June 2016 meeting between top campaign officials such as Donald Trump Jr and several Russians with ties to the Kremlin. There has been some debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constitutes a campaign finance violation, but Mr Mueller declined to file charges.  Mr Trump's Ukrainian call could also potentially run afoul of federal bribery statutes. The special counsel concluded that Justice Department policy guidelines prohibit a sitting president from being indicted, however, so even if Mr Trump did commit some kind of crime with his actions, he's safe at the moment from criminal prosecution. With this in mind, a more relevant question might be … The constitutional process for handling a president who committed illegal and-or unethical acts is impeachment by a majority of the House of Representatives and conviction and removal by a two-thirds majority of the US Senate. The US constitution outlines the grounds for impeachment as ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"". When it comes down to it, an ""impeachable offense"" is whatever a majority of the House says it is. Ever since the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, the drumbeat for impeachment among Democrats - who hold a comfortable majority in the House - has been steadily increasing. Initially, however, the House Democratic leadership was loath to push ahead with a formal investigation that could lead to an impeachment vote. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had suggested that such a move could damage the electoral prospects of Democrats in moderate congressional districts and would in the end be meaningless because the Republicans who hold the majority in the Senate would never vote to remove the president. But then on Tuesday, Ms Pelosi announced that Democrats were opening a formal impeachment inquiry.  She said the president had committed ""a violation of the law"", and called his actions ""a breach of his constitutional responsibilities"". She said he ""must be held accountable"". The allegations against the Bidens pushed by Mr Trump and his lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, centre on the then-vice-president's successful effort to force out top Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016. Mr Shokin's office was responsible for investigations into a Ukrainian gas company, Burisima Holdings, which at the time was paying Hunter Biden, Mr Biden's son, as much as $50,000 a month to serve on its board of directors.  Mr Trump, Mr Giuliani and others allege that the vice-president's pressure, which included the threat to withhold $1bn in US loan guarantees to the country, was an effort to protect his son and his company from potentially criminal exposure. No evidence has so far been produced to indicate that Joe Biden either acted corruptly or was influenced by his son's work in Ukraine. However, critics believe at the very least the Biden family's ties to Ukraine raise the perception of a possible conflict of interest. Cutting against these allegations is the fact that Mr Biden was not the only public official - in the US, among EU countries and in Ukraine - calling for Mr Shokin's removal.  And as the New York Times recently noted, the Ukrainian prosecutor was not ""aggressively pursuing"" investigations into Burisima at the time, but was accused of using the threat of prosecution to solicit bribes from company leaders. In addition, Mr Shokin's replacement, Yuriy Lutsenko, continued to investigate Burisima for 10 months before ending all legal proceedings. Reporting by Anthony Zurcher and Tara McKelvey "

47,Parliament resumes: Your questions answered,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:26:51 GMT",Website readers ask what happens now that MPs have returned to the House of Commons.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49827455,"MPs have returned to Parliament a day after the Supreme Court ruled that the decision to suspend sittings for five weeks was unlawful. On Tuesday we answered your questions on the ruling and now we are looking at queries received from readers about what happens now that the House of Commons is back in session. While Parliament has passed a law that tries to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, it can't make such an outcome illegal. That's because a no-deal Brexit is the legal default outcome - unless a deal is passed or Brexit is cancelled altogether.  Under the law passed by MPs, Mr Johnson is required to request a three-month Brexit delay by 19 October. The only exceptions are if MPs vote for no deal or pass a deal beforehand. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also insists the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""do or die"". So, assuming the government is required to seek an extension, it's currently unclear how Mr Johnson will meet his Brexit pledge while complying with the law at the same time. MPs normally vote to have a recess during the traditional autumn party conference period. When Parliament is in recess, no sittings take place. But because the government decided to prorogue Parliament, no such recess vote took place.   Now that Parliament has resumed, sittings will be scheduled to take place on the final three days of the Conservative Party conference which runs from 29 September to 2 October.  That means Conservative MPs may have to choose between attending the Manchester conference and sitting in Westminster. To avoid this, the government may decide to ask MPs to agree to a short recess. But even if a recess vote was introduced, there is no guarantee the government would win. Yes. In theory, the EU could offer a Brexit extension without the UK having to request one first, as long as the other 27 member countries agreed. However, any offer from the EU wouldn't automatically change the UK's exit date. That's because Parliament also has to amend the legislation which sets the day of the UK's departure in stone. This is what happened when the original exit day was moved from 29 March - after MPs debated and voted on the issue. It is possible a change of government could happen without an election. That's because the prime minister is ultimately the person who commands the ""confidence"" of the House of Commons. So if another individual, such as Jeremy Corbyn, can show they have the support of a majority of MPs, it is possible that an alternative government could form. This could be achieved through a formal motion of no confidence. If the opposition propose such a vote, the government would be expected to make time for it as soon as practically possible.  If a simple majority of MPs vote in favour, then the government falls. Opposition parties then have 14 days to try to form an alternative government. If this fails to happen, or the government fails to regain the confidence of the Commons, then a general election is automatically triggered.  In recent decades the Queen's role with regards to parliamentary matters has been more symbolic and ceremonial than anything else. There has been an unwritten rule for many years that nothing would ever be done to put her in a position where she could be accused of having a political role. The prorogation of Parliament happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it and in reality, she would have had no choice other than to grant Mr Johnson's request to do this. After the Scottish Court of Session case into the suspension, a Palace source told the BBC: ""The Queen acts and acted on the advice of her ministers."" When a prime minister stands down they go to Buckingham Palace to offer the Queen their resignation. If it is not obvious who might succeed them, the outgoing PM would usually recommend someone who can command the ""confidence"" of the House of Commons. That's because the Queen must have a prime minister at all times. When a party in government has a majority, the successor is usually obvious. The position will go to their successor as party leader.   But there are no firm rules about what would happen under a minority government if a prime minister refuses to nominate a successor or was incapacitated in some way. Under such a scenario, it's likely that the Queen would have to seek other advice, possibly from the cabinet. But she may have to choose the appointee herself, according to Catherine Haddon from the Institute of Government.   In such a scenario the Queen would probably have two options - someone recommended by the existing cabinet, or opting for the Leader of the Opposition, whose role, historically, has been to act as a government-in-waiting in case of such circumstances, says Ms Haddon.   The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for all UK civil cases, and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  It does not consider cases brought by individuals, only ones from lower courts when a relevant order has been made. The Supreme Court concentrates on cases of the greatest public and constitutional importance."
