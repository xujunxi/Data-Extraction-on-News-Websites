0,White House Bars Iranian Officials From U.S. as Its Diplomatic Efforts Falter,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 01:14:07 +0000","Farnaz Fassihi, Lara Jakes and Edward Wong","The move was extraordinary given that dozens of Iranian diplomats were in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, though it was not expected to force them to leave.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/middleeast/us-iran-rouhani-trump.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"UNITED NATIONS — The Trump administration barred senior Iranian government officials from entering the United States on Wednesday, just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani as he attended an annual gathering of world leaders in New York. The order followed a new round of American economic penalties against China, Iran’s largest oil customer, to further squeeze the Iranian economy and force Tehran into new negotiations to limit its nuclear and military programs. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month. “We want peace and we want a peaceful resolution,” Mr. Pompeo said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon with President Trump. “In the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision whether they choose violence and hate.” The White House announced the new travel restrictions on senior Iranian government officials and their family members shortly after the news conference ended. In a statement, it described the Iranian government as a state sponsor of terrorism that threatened the stability of the Middle East and beyond. It was an extraordinary declaration, given its timing: Mr. Rouhani and more than 80 of his top diplomats and aides were in New York attending the annual United Nations General Assembly. However, the travel ban was not expected to force them to leave; the United States generally issues visas to allow foreign leaders to come to United Nations headquarters, but tightly restricts their movements while in New York. A similar travel ban was issued against members of President Nicolás Maduro’s government in Venezuela, which the Trump administration is trying to oust. In a morning speech to the General Assembly, Mr. Rouhani appeared to shut down any attempt at détente with what he described as an “enemy who uses sanction and poverty as a tool.” He also devoted considerable time to berating the Trump administration for inviting him to talk while threatening Iran. “If you want a ‘yes’ response, then the only road to negotiations is returning to your commitments,” Mr. Rouhani said, referring to Mr. Trump’s repudiation of a 2015 nuclear accord that eased international sanctions in return for limiting Iran’s nuclear activities. “A photo opportunity is the last stop, not the first stop.” The new economic sanctions were announced by Mr. Pompeo at a conference sponsored by United Against Nuclear Iran, an advocacy group that Tehran this week said it was considering declaring a terrorist organization. Mr. Pompeo said the sanctions would punish six Chinese companies and five business executives for defying American financial restrictions that aim to stop Iran from exporting oil. The targeted businesses are an oil company and five shipping companies, two of which are subsidiaries of a large state-owned conglomerate, China COSCO Shipping. But the parent company is not a target. China has been the biggest foreign buyer of Iran’s oil, a crucial Iranian export. Last year, roughly 6 percent of China’s oil imports came from Iran. But in the past two months, Chinese state-owned companies have begun importing more oil from Saudi Arabia under tightening pressure from the Trump administration. A New York Times investigation found that at least six Iranian tankers unloaded at Chinese ports during a two-month period after the United States on May 2 ended purchase waivers for Iranian oil granted to China and seven other governments. In July, the State Department announced its first set of Iran-related sanctions against a Chinese oil company. But the United States has avoided sanctioning Chinese banks or Sinopec, a much larger state-owned company that is also a big importer of Iranian oil. Sanctions on those institutions would have far-reaching effects in global finance and business. Some analysts believe the oil sanctions and other penalties imposed by the Trump administration are what set Tehran on its current course of confrontation with the United States and its partners in the Persian Gulf region. The administration’s so-called maximum pressure campaign “has not only failed to secure a better deal with Iran on its nuclear activities and problematic Iranian regional behavior, but actually created problems that did not previously exist,” said Andrew Miller, a former State Department official who is deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy. European officials, led by President Emmanuel Macron of France, had for weeks sought to broker talks between the United States and Iran on the sidelines of the General Assembly. Diplomats from the nations still party to the 2015 nuclear accord — Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia — all committed during a Wednesday morning meeting to try to preserve it, said Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief. “We all welcome the efforts being made to open the channel of dialogue,” said Ms. Mogherini. She predicted it would be difficult to save the nuclear deal but said Iran could easily return to compliance. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described it as “a good meeting” but declined to comment further. The diplomatic breakdown followed an overnight flurry of messages between Iranian and European officials about a possible meeting on Wednesday between Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Trump. Hard-line members of the power hierarchy in Iran who are especially suspicious of the American government applauded Mr. Rouhani’s rejection of talks. “If such a thing happens Messrs Rouhani and Zarif must know they will pay a very high price,” said Javad Karimi Ghodoosi, a member of Parliament. At the nuclear conference, Mr. Pompeo appeared to taunt Iran, describing its “panicked aggression” in reaction to the American pressure campaign. He also said Iran’s leaders respond to “strength and not to supplication” and drew titters from the audience when he noted that Mr. Rouhani had claimed of working to bring peace to the Middle East. In his speech, Mr. Pompeo again accused Iran of bombing four oil tankers in the Persian Gulf in May, downing an unmanned American spy drone in June and attacking oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month as evidence of its “long history of unprovoked aggression.” Iran has denied responsibility for the Sept. 14 strikes on the Saudi oil facilities, which Mr. Pompeo has called an “act of war” and which again raised the specter of a new military conflict in the Middle East. Officials in the Gulf also blamed Iran for the attacks but urged caution, and not until this week did diplomats from Britain, France and Germany publicly agree that they considered Tehran responsible for the strikes. Mr. Pompeo said the United States also would intensify warnings to countries and companies against doing business with entities linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a branch of Iran’s military. The United States declared the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization this year; the broad designation prohibits doing business with as many as 11 million Iranians and affiliated groups. The developments at the United Nations unfolded as the fate of a Swedish-owned, British-flagged oil tanker, the Steno Impero, detained in Iran for months, remained unclear two days after the Iranians said the ship was free to leave. An Iranian official on Wednesday said that while the detention order on the ship had been lifted, it may not leave Iran because of a pending inquiry into the ship’s conduct. The ship has not budged from the southern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. Its seizure was widely seen as retaliation for the earlier detention of an Iranian vessel, the Grace 1, later renamed the Adrian Darya, in Gibraltar. That vessel was released in August."
1,"In a Twist, Netanyahu Wins a Chance to Keep His Job","Thu, 26 Sep 2019 01:10:58 +0000",Isabel Kershner,"The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, must now assemble a parliamentary majority, a task that eluded him in the previous election.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/middleeast/israel-election-results-netanyahu.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"After the polls closed in the Israeli election last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to have suffered a humiliating blow. His chief opponent, Benny Gantz, a former military chief and leader of the centrist Blue and White party, emerged slightly ahead of the conservative Likud leader and seemed on course to be given the first chance to form Israel’s next government. But by Wednesday, in a surprise twist, Mr. Netanyahu — long called “the magician” for his political survival skills — was back on center stage. President Reuven Rivlin chose him to try to cobble together a coalition, opening the door to a continued shift to the right for Israel and offering a potential political lifeline to Mr. Netanyahu, who faces a looming indictment for corruption. Still, the reversal of fortune falls short of a victory, and Mr. Netanyahu’s future in office remains far from assured. He has 28 days to assemble a majority of at least 61 seats in Parliament and no clear path to that number. The parties that have endorsed his bid for another term won just 55 seats. Mr. Netanyahu’s chances of success are “not good but not impossible,” said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a political scientist at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. “He’s pulled rabbits out of the hat before.” This is the second time Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has been given the chance to form a government in five months. He and his right-wing and ultra-Orthodox allies won a plurality in the previous election in April but failed to assemble a majority coalition in its aftermath, leading to a repeat election this month. He was dealt a slightly worse hand this time, leaving many Israelis wondering how he could possibly find a majority now that he couldn’t last time. Mr. Rivlin seemed to acknowledge as much, saying he was handing the mandate to form a government to Mr. Netanyahu because his chances were greater than Mr. Gantz’s “at the moment.” Mr. Gantz won the endorsements of only 54 lawmakers, one shy of Mr. Netanyahu’s total, but 10 of them were from Arab lawmakers who said they would not join a Gantz government. Mr. Rivlin apparently discounted those endorsements for that reason. But eight days after the election, it could still play out in any number of ways, taking Israel’s future with it. Mr. Netanyahu could tempt his former ally turned rival, Avigdor Liberman, leader of the secular, ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, which won eight seats, back into a partnership. Mr. Liberman has said he would refuse to join a coalition with Mr. Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, but perhaps, some analysts said, he would renege on his election promises, citing the good of the country. Mr. Rivlin had been pushing Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz to forge a broad unity government including both their parties, saying that was the will of the voters. And on Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu said a unity government was the only way out of the political stalemate. “Neither of us can form a government other than with each other,” Mr. Netanyahu said. And after a difficult election campaign, he said, a unity government was essential “to achieve national reconciliation.” A unity government could set the country on a more moderate, unifying path after years of increasingly polarizing right-wing and religious governments. But that, too, seems unlikely for now. Mr. Gantz has vowed not to sit in a government led by a prime minister facing indictment, and he reiterated that position on Wednesday. Mr. Netanyahu faces possible indictments in three corruption cases, and a special hearing with the attorney general has been scheduled for next Wednesday. He could be charged in the coming weeks or months. Mr. Netanyahu floated a government with “joint leadership,” without elaborating. But Mr. Gantz said he could not see a way to a power-sharing agreement since Mr. Netanyahu had already signed a pact with three right-wing and religious parties to stick together in any coalition negotiations. Mr. Gantz has advocated a secular and liberal unity government excluding ultra-Orthodox parties. At least one of the ultra-Orthodox parties has ruled out joining a government with the No. 2 person in Blue and White, Yair Lapid. If there are to be compromises and horse-trading, they may not be likely soon. If Mr. Netanyahu fails to assemble a majority coalition in 28 days, the president could grant him a 14-day extension. If Mr. Netanyahu still fails, the mantle could be passed to Mr. Gantz, who would then have another 28 days to form a government. “Then,” said Ayelet Frish, an Israeli political consultant, “they both will have their backs to the wall. Public opinion will demand they both compromise to avoid a third election.” At that point, Ms. Frish said, Mr. Netanyahu could give up on his right-wing and religious allies. And Mr. Gantz could drop his commitment not to sit in a government with Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Rivlin has already suggested one creative solution in which Mr. Netanyahu would declare himself incapacitated if charged, but maintain the title of prime minister for the duration of his trial, with Mr. Gantz serving as acting prime minister. Experts have suggested that Mr. Gantz actually preferred to have the second turn at forming a government, after Mr. Netanyahu, figuring that it might be easier to persuade potential partners or defectors by then. There’s yet another possibility gaining traction among pundits: that Mr. Netanyahu won’t be able to form a government and will return the mandate to Mr. Rivlin, possibly even before the 28 days are up. Mr. Rivlin could then give Mr. Gantz a turn. But Mr. Netanyahu will be banking on Mr. Gantz failing, forcing Israel into a third election. That would allow Mr. Netanyahu to extend his tenure as prime minister until another election is decided. Remaining in office is essential for Mr. Netanyahu. If he is criminally charged, he can continue to serve as prime minister until a final conviction. If he is in some lesser ministerial role, he will have to resign. But also, he could blame Mr. Gantz for not joining his government and bringing on an election few Israelis want. “The main thing here,” Mr. Wolfsfeld said, “is who’s going to be blamed if we have a third round of elections.” Mr. Netanyahu, he added, “has nothing to lose.”"
2,China Wants the World to Stay Silent on Muslim Camps. It’s Succeeding.,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:48:49 +0000",Jane Perlez,"Beijing is using economic and diplomatic pressure to quash any outcry, while governments are reluctant to risk financial ties and trade deals.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/asia/china-xinjiang-muslim-camps.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"BEIJING — When Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visited Beijing this summer, he hailed a new Silk Road bridging Asia and Europe. He welcomed big Chinese investments for his beleaguered economy. He gushed about China’s sovereignty. But Mr. Erdogan, who has stridently promoted Islamic values in his overwhelmingly Muslim country, was largely silent on the incarceration of more than one million Turkic Muslims in China’s western region of Xinjiang, and the forced assimilation of millions more. It was an about-face from a decade ago, when he said the Uighurs there suffered from, “simply put, genocide” at the hands of the Chinese government. Like Mr. Erdogan, the world has been noticeably quiet about Xinjiang, where China has built a vast network of detention camps and systematic surveillance over the past two years in a state-led operation to convert Uighurs into loyal, secular supporters of the Communist Party. Even when diplomats have witnessed the problems firsthand and privately condemned them, they have been reluctant to go public, unable to garner broad support or unwilling to risk financial ties with China. Backed by its diplomatic and economic might, China has largely succeeded in quashing criticism. Chinese officials have convinced countries to support Beijing publicly on the issue, most notably Muslim ones in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. They have played to the discord within the West over China. And they have waged an aggressive campaign to prevent discussion of Xinjiang at the United Nations. At a special event ahead of the General Assembly this week on protecting religious freedom, President Trump, the host of the event, did not mention the Uighurs. Vice President Mike Pence gave a nod to the Uighurs, after mentioning the persecution of Christians in China. China contends that its state-mandated detention camps, surrounded by high walls and watchtowers, are central to its fight against Islamist extremism. Beijing has called them boarding schools, explaining detainees are there voluntarily. China said recently that it has reduced the numbers in the camps, although doubts persist about the claim. “There has not been a single case of violent terrorism in the past three years,” Wang Yi, state councilor and foreign minister of China, said at an event on the sidelines of the United Nations summit. “The education and training centers are schools that help the people free themselves from terrorism and extremism and acquire useful skills.” [China said it closed Muslim detention camps. There’s reason to doubt that.] As countries weigh their options over Xinjiang, China’s economic heft looms large. Officials in the Trump administration have been among the most vocal critics. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has denounced the treatment of the Uighurs as the “stain of the century.” One of his deputies, John Sullivan, who convened a panel Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations meeting with several other countries to condemn Beijing’s policies, said China has carried out a “horrific campaign of repression.” While the National Security Council has pushed economic sanctions over the issue, the Treasury has the power to punish China in that way. So far, the trade talks have taken precedence. And Mr. Trump has largely ignored the issue, essentially giving China a pass. The administration’s limited action probably affects the global calculus. If the United States does not take a leadership role on the issue, other countries do not feel the pressure to act, either. Some governments tiptoe around China for economic reasons. When New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, visited Beijing shortly after the massacre of 51 Muslims in Christchurch, she said she had discussed Xinjiang privately with China’s president Xi Jinping. She didn’t do much more. New Zealand sells much of its main exports, such as milk, meat and wine, to China. Last year, China helped Turkey secure a $3.6 billion loan for energy and transportation. Since then, the Turkish economy has further faltered. And during Mr. Erdogan’s visit to Beijing in July, Mr. Xi praised him for supporting what he called China’s core interests, including Xinjiang. “Many, many governments are looking the other way and self-censoring on the issue of Xinjiang,” said Daniel R. Russel, the Obama administration’s assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. “Beijing is notoriously prickly about its self-declared ‘core interests,’ and few countries are willing to put the economic benefits of good relations with China at risk — let alone find themselves on the receiving end of Chinese retaliation.” When countries do criticize China, they tend to do so in a group, seemingly as a way to diffuse and lessen possible retribution. In Geneva this summer, nearly two dozen, mostly Western, countries, along with Japan, banded together at the United Nations Human Rights Council to call on China to close the camps. No one country was willing to be the organizer. Instead, the statement’s signers relied on a rarely used procedure that allowed it to be circulated without a principal leader. Not to be outmaneuvered by the critics, China quickly prepared a counter-roster of 37 friendly nations praising its “contribution to the international human rights cause.” Among the cheerleaders were members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation that unanimously endorsed China’s Xinjiang policies in April. China is carefully shaping its image of Xinjiang in the diplomatic world. Over the past nine months, Beijing has invited select visitors on circumscribed tours of the detention camps to garner positive publicity. China has generally handpicked the visitors, including journalists from friendly countries. They are then often quoted in the state-run Chinese news media offering flattering comments. “I saw genuine smiles on the faces of trainees I interviewed,” Abdul Aziz Raddad A. Alrabie of the Saudi newspaper Okaz said in China Daily, a newspaper of the Communist Party. The trips do not always go as planned. Two reports — one by a Malaysian diplomat and another by European Union officials — were highly critical after their visits. The private account by the Malaysian diplomat, reviewed by The New York Times, contradicted China’s contention that the Uighurs were voluntarily attending the re-education centers. “Delegates could actually sense fear and frustration from the students,” the Malaysian wrote after his December visit with a dozen other diplomats from mostly Muslim nations. “China may have legitimate reasons to implement policies intended to eliminate the threat of terrorism, especially in Xinjiang. However, judging by its approach, it is addressing the issue wrongly and illegitimately, e.g. preventing Muslim minors from learning the Quran.” The diplomat referred to two cities in Xinjiang — once-bustling Kashgar and Hotan — as “zombie towns,” saying the streets were virtually empty and that China was probably “using the threat of terrorism as an excuse to ‘sanitize’ Uighur Muslims until they become acceptable Chinese citizens.” The report was never made public. At the time, Malaysia was working hard to repair relations with China over a troubled infrastructure deal. It has also become increasingly dependent on China for purchases of palm oil, its biggest export. “The $100 billion in annual bilateral trade is enough to focus the minds of Malaysian policymakers,” said Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies in Kuala Lumpur. “China is too big a market to lose.” Three diplomats from the European Union visited Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, this year in what one of the participants said turned out to be a “Potemkin village tour.” The officials were shown a hastily built display of weapons that the Chinese guides said Uighurs had used in terrorist attacks; a mosque where there was no sign of religious observance; and a kindergarten where the children sang songs praising the party. At one camp, the class sang the Communist Party anthem. As they did, one Uighur man caught the eye of a diplomat and held up his wrists as if clamped together by handcuffs. Afterward, the European Union circulated an internal document saying that the visit “does not invalidate the E.U.’s profound concerns about human rights in Xinjiang, including in relation to mass detention, political re-education, religious freedom and Sinicization policies, as well as concerns that similar measures could be applied in other regions of China with notable Muslim minorities.” Rifts within the European Union on how to deal with China prevent a common front. Leaders in France and Germany are publicly silent on Xinjiang, while several Eastern European countries are supporters of China. At the United Nations, China has made Xinjiang its main cause. The Human Rights Council in Geneva is often considered a diplomatic backwater. The United States is no longer a member, with the Trump administration withdrawing last year in protest over policies toward Israel. As authoritarian governments gain power around the world, human rights are less of a front-and-center issue, leaving the council with less sway. But China regards the council as a serious arena where it can outmaneuver its opponents, pursue its diplomatic agenda and score points. A long-scheduled review of China’s human rights record was on the council’s schedule last November just as the Uighurs’ incarceration was gaining attention. China prepared meticulously. About 60 Chinese diplomats flew to Switzerland from Beijing, a delegation headed by the influential vice foreign minister, Le Yucheng. He was backed by 40 more members of Chinese government organizations. Such a large entourage of nondiplomats was almost unheard-of at the council, according to diplomats. They acted as cheerleaders, clapping at key moments. One goal of the performance was to limit backing for an inspection of Xinjiang by Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations’ human rights chief. “If you’re really serious about a fact-finding mission, please go check the southern border, Guantánamo, the Mediterranean to see if there have been fact-finding missions,” one of the Chinese advocates said, according to a recording by the International Service for Human Rights. At the end of China’s presentation, more than 120 countries gave a positive review of its human rights record. Fewer than three dozen countries expressed real concern. Ms. Bachelet has not visited Xinjiang. At the United Nations in New York, China has assiduously worked many angles. At one Security Council meeting last year that was set to discuss human rights violations in Syria, China intervened. It was concerned that the discussion would veer into one on Xinjiang. The United Nations’ high commissioner of human rights at the time, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, traveled to New York to address the session. Suddenly, as the diplomats were about to convene, Ivory Coast withdrew support for the discussion on Syria. Since there was no longer a quorum for the session, it was canceled. Ivory Coast’s ambassador explained that his president had received a call from Beijing instructing him to ensure the session did not happen. “If you can’t get a discussion on Syria after all these seven years of brutality, of course you can block a discussion on Xinjiang,” Mr. al-Hussein said."
3,Boris Johnson Back Home. Parliament Back in Session. What Could Go Wrong?,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 22:47:23 +0000",Stephen Castle,"After a stinging Supreme Court defeat, the prime minister came out fighting on Brexit. He also infuriated some lawmakers by invoking the memory of Jo Cox, a Brexit opponent.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/europe/boris-johnson-brexit-parliament.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — A day after suffering a crushing rebuke from his country’s highest court, a notably unchastened Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared before a hastily reconvened Parliament and doubled down on his hard-line Brexit approach. If anyone had expected Mr. Johnson to appear before the lawmakers hat in hand after being forced to cut short a trip to the United Nations and return back home, they were presumably disappointed. “Come on!” Mr. Johnson yelled over a barrage of jeers as he urged his opponents to stage a vote of no confidence in him. “Humbug,” he declared, when one Labour lawmaker, Paula Sherriff, made an emotional plea for him to stop using inflammatory language. Mr. Johnson was not meant to be in Parliament on Wednesday. Neither were M.P.s. But a day earlier, the British Supreme Court ruled that the prime minister had acted unlawfully in orchestrating the suspension of Parliament as he made a final drive to withdraw Britain from the European Union, “do or die.” With that, lawmakers who had been told to hit the road for five weeks found themselves unexpectedly back in their seats. They promptly set about waving the prime minister’s legal defeat in his face. Amid a scene of tumult, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called on Mr. Johnson to resign, describing him as a “dangerous prime minister who thinks he is above the law” and unfit for office. “For the good of the country he should go,” Mr. Corbyn said. Mr. Johnson and his colleagues were unmoved, even in the face of a unanimous ruling against them by the court. “It is absolutely no disrespect to the judiciary to say I think the court was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy,” the prime minister told lawmakers. The issue of whether Parliament could be sent away, he argued, was not one for the courts. Mr. Johnson went on to goad his opponents, accusing them of “sheer selfishness and political cowardice,” for refusing to agree to a general election, and challenging them to try to force him out. He also infuriated some lawmakers when he said that the best way of bringing the country together and of honoring the memory of Jo Cox — a Labour lawmaker who was murdered in 2016 — was to get Brexit done. Ms. Cox was an opponent of Brexit. Mr. Johnson’s bombastic appearance did little to dispel the impression that he wants to present himself to voters as the champion of the people against a Parliament that is blocking the Brexit that Britons voted for in a 2016 referendum. But for the moment, Parliament is not giving him his election. Instead, the opposition is trying to subject Mr. Johnson to a form of slow political torture, seeking to weaken him and to force him to break his promise to leave the European Union by Oct. 31, even if he cannot reach a formal agreement with Brussels on the terms of departure. An election, Mr. Corbyn said, can take place as soon as Mr. Johnson secures another delay to withdrawal, avoiding the possibility of a “no deal” Brexit. Mr. Corbyn also took the opportunity to bring up new conflict-of-interest allegations against the beleaguered prime minister over public funding given, when he was mayor of London, to an American entrepreneur and close friend, Jennifer Arcuri. The mood was stormy on another remarkable day in the Brexit saga. Mr. Johnson has promised to extract Britain from the European Union by the end of next month, even if it means an economically risky exit without any agreement. But opposition lawmakers think they have him in a trap. A law passed earlier this month would force Mr. Johnson to seek a third Brexit delay if he cannot strike a new exit deal that Parliament can ratify. Mr. Johnson insisted on Wednesday that he was pursuing an agreement, but the highly charged atmosphere at Westminster probably makes it less likely that any new Brexit deal could get through Parliament, even if one can be negotiated with the European Union. Though there is speculation that Mr. Johnson might try to find a legal loophole to prevent him having to apply for a Brexit extension, no obvious one has emerged so far. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has said the government will comply with the law. But at the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr. Cox also declared that, in failing to agree on any Brexit path, Parliament was a “disgrace.” “It is a dead Parliament,” he said. “It has no moral right to sit on these green benches.” He dismissed lawmakers as “too cowardly” to set a general election. That provoked a furious response from one Labour lawmaker, Barry Sheerman, who said the government had tried to shut down Parliament so that it “couldn’t work as a democratic assembly.” Shouting and pointing across the chamber at Mr. Cox and the Conservative benches, he said, “For a man like him, a party like this, a leader like this, this prime minister, to talk about morals and morality is a disgrace.” Beyond angry lawmakers, Mr. Johnson faces some logistical problems. Unless lawmakers agree to a short suspension of Parliament, his Conservative Party conference, scheduled for Sunday in Manchester, might have to be reorganized, and even curtailed, because lawmakers will be needed in London. The government was also planning to open a new session of Parliament next month, to showcase its policy agenda. But that would require Mr. Johnson to ask Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliamentary sittings. Again. This suspension would be brief, given that its last attempt to do so landed Mr. Johnson in such hot water, the government will have to be careful how it proceeds with any new request."
4,Indonesia’s Leader Faces Student Protests and Crises Heading Into New Term,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 01:52:46 +0000",Richard C. Paddock,President Joko Widodo’s decision to limit the power of Indonesia’s anticorruption commission has helped set off protests before his second term begins.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/asia/indonesia-joko-widodo-protests.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, preparing for his second term, faces a sudden loss of public support amid mounting crises, including student protests, burning forests and deadly violence in distant Papua province. Mr. Joko won re-election handily in April, defeating his main rival by 11 percentage points. But even before his scheduled inauguration next month, his handling of a controversial corruption bill threatens to undermine his second-term agenda. The president’s popular support began falling, political analysts said, when he approved passage of legislation this month to strip the respected Corruption Eradication Commission of key powers, including the authority to wiretap public officials suspected of wrongdoing. Student protesters have called on Mr. Joko to revoke the measure and restore the commission’s power by issuing an emergency decree, but he said on Monday that he would not. “The revision of the law on corruption was the blunder that made the public very angry with him,” said Djayadi Hanan, executive director of the Indonesia Survey Institute, an independent polling group. “He has to start by winning back the public trust and the only way to do that is to repeal the law.” Thousands of angry students staged protests in major cities this week over the corruption law and other legislation, including a far-reaching overhaul of the criminal code, that are seen as benefiting the elite while depriving ordinary people of important rights. In Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 protested outside the Parliament building on Tuesday, blocking traffic, pulling down fencing and torching a police post. The protests continued into Wednesday. The police fired tear gas and water cannons to prevent demonstrators from entering the compound. Officials said dozens were arrested and 265 protesters and 39 police officers were injured. The students’ list of demands has grown beyond the corruption bill, including ending the burning of Indonesia’s rainforests and punishing corporations responsible for forest fires; halting military action in Papua and freeing political prisoners; and rejecting legislation that would give companies greater power over natural resources, ban sex outside marriage and limit freedom of expression. Nearly 2,000 fires continued to burn out of control in Indonesia’s forests on Wednesday, causing respiratory problems for nearly a million people. Many of the fires were set illegally by palm oil plantations and other companies to clear land for more planting, the authorities say. [Fires Rage in Indonesia, Turning the Sky Red.] Critics contend that lax enforcement against palm oil and paper products companies during Mr. Joko’s first term has encouraged the continued burning of the rainforests, a significant contributor to the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. In Papua, Indonesia’s easternmost province, at least 32 people died on Monday in antigovernment protests. Many victims died in buildings that were set on fire, the authorities said. Papua, which makes up the western half of the island of Papua New Guinea, was annexed by Indonesia in the 1960s and has been the scene of a low-level war of independence ever since. Most of Monday’s victims were nonindigenous Papuan people, the police said. Indonesian officials blamed the deaths on activists who sought to attract international attention to their struggle for independence during this week’s United Nations General Assembly session in New York. Mr. Joko, a former furniture manufacturer and Jakarta governor, has long cast himself as a man of the people, and he campaigned on a promise to crack down on widespread corruption. Until now, the Corruption Eradication Commission has operated with unusual autonomy and has had considerable success in bringing down corrupt politicians. Mr. Joko surprised many of his supporters by backing the legislation that would undermine the commission by creating an advisory body to supervise its activities. The commission’s independence would also be undermined by a requirement that it hire its staff from among civil servants rather than from outside government. Although the bill passed Parliament with Mr. Joko’s approval, he has the power to repeal it by issuing an emergency declaration. Continuing street protests could give him the pretext he needed if he were to change his mind. The question for the president, Mr. Djayadi said, was whether the benefit to his powerful allies of gutting the corruption commission outweighed the loss of public support it was creating as he begins his second five-year term. “Maybe losing some trust of the public is not a big issue for Jokowi,” he said, using the president’s nickname. “If he is thinking that public support is no longer important to him, he can continue with this corruption law.” Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the corruption measure was just one part of a three-pronged effort by the outgoing Parliament to benefit Indonesia’s oligarchs. Several bills that were under consideration by Parliament would give businesses greater control over land, mining and other natural resources. One bill privatizing water supplies has already passed. The broad revision of the criminal code would have enacted numerous proposals favored by hard-line Islamists, such as banning sex outside marriage, effectively banning gay and lesbian relations. It would also have curtailed free expression by strengthening blasphemy and treason laws and prohibiting insulting the president, the vice president, the government or state agencies. Mr. Joko called on Parliament last week not to pass the measure before its five-year session ends on Monday, but it is likely to be reintroduced once the new Parliament is seated. Obed Kresna Widyapratistha, a student at Gadjah Mada University in the city of Yogyakarta, said he had joined in protests there in part because of his opposition to the crime bill and its intrusion into private affairs. He also said Mr. Joko was too closely aligned with political elites and generals who served under the former dictator Suharto in the era known as the New Order. “As a citizen who looks at the government from the outside, I feel that Jokowi has compromised too much with the New Order generals, with the political parties, with the political oligarchs in this country,” he said. “I am very disappointed.” Dodi Ambardi, a professor of political science at the same university, said Mr. Joko might be willing to compromise on corruption eradication and intrusions in people’s private lives for the sake of achieving his top priority: stimulating economic growth. Mr. Joko, he noted, was barred from running for a third term and might have concluded that popular support at this moment was not crucial and that winning the support of members of Parliament and local officials — all of whom feared the power of the corruption commission — might be more important in enacting his policies. “This is the second term of Jokowi and he will not run again,” Mr. Dodi said. “Electoral support is not needed. Running the government effectively and efficiently is more important for Jokowi.”"
5,"Who Is Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukraine President in the Trump Impeachment Crisis?","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:31:53 +0000",Andrew E. Kramer,"Mr. Zelensky acted in a comedy before becoming Ukraine’s president, and has been thrust into the center of the American debate.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-facts-history-bio.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"KIEV, Ukraine — As a television actor in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky played an idealistic schoolteacher whose tirade against corruption is filmed by his students, winds up online and suddenly goes viral, propelling him to the presidency. The show was a comedy. But the message of fighting back-room wheeling and dealing proved so popular that Mr. Zelensky started a political party named after the program, “Servant of the People,” and ended up becoming Ukraine’s president for real — with a life-mimics-art campaign that built his image as an anti-corruption crusader. Now, Mr. Zelensky, a 41-year-old political novice who took office in May, is at the center of an impeachment debate in the United States over whether President Trump tried to pressure him into betraying the principles that catapulted him into office. Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have said publicly that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should be investigated in connection with his son’s role in a Ukrainian energy company. Mr. Trump acknowledged raising the corruption allegations in a phone call with Mr. Zelensky on July 25, intensifying claims by Democrats in Congress that Mr. Trump inappropriately pressed a foreign government to undermine one of his main challengers in the 2020 American presidential race. The uproar grew after senior administration officials said that Mr. Trump personally ordered the suspension of $391 million in aid to Ukraine in the days before the call. One of the big questions is whether Mr. Trump used vital funds for Ukraine — a country battling pro-Russian separatists — as a cudgel to dig up dirt on his political rival in the United States. Mr. Trump has described his call with Ukraine’s president as “totally appropriate” and said there was “no quid pro quo” linking American aid to a Ukrainian investigation into Mr. Biden. But while the issue has put Mr. Zelensky in an uncomfortable bind, he has not announced any new investigations into Mr. Biden or his son. In fact, during his call with Mr. Trump in July, Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Trump that the new Ukrainian government had a policy of not intervening in the nation’s criminal justice system, according to a presidential aide, Andriy Yermak. Mr. Yermak, who discussed the call during an interview in August — before it became a focus of congressional investigations in the United States — said he had already conveyed the same message to Mr. Giuliani, who had been openly pressing Ukrainian officials to investigate Mr. Biden. “I know that Mr. Zelensky, in a conversation with Mr. Trump, said the same: that the principle of the new government in Ukraine is openness and respect for law and lack of interference of the government in the judicial system,” Mr. Yermak said of the phone call between the two presidents. The controversy has thrust Mr. Zelensky — who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump on Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly — directly onto center stage in a standoff between Mr. Trump and Democratic members of Congress who want to impeach him. In past interactions between Ukrainian and American officials, the Americans have typically been the ones lecturing their Ukrainian counterparts about rooting out political influence over the courts, a problem in most post-Soviet countries. The practice even has a name — “telephone justice” — referring to the surreptitious phone calls placed by politicians to prosecutors and judges. But in this case, the roles were reversed — and the new administration in Ukraine did not bend to the American pressure, said a senior Western diplomat in Kiev familiar with the exchanges between Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani and the Ukrainian government. Still, the encounters with Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have left Mr. Zelensky and his aides a bit shocked, the diplomat said. Mr. Giuliani’s pressure for an investigation of Mr. Biden began before Mr. Zelensky’s inauguration in May, placing the new government in a tough position, said Serhiy M. Marchenko, a deputy chief of staff under Ukraine’s former president. “If we help the Trump administration in some process that damages Biden, in the long run we harm relations with the Democrats,” Mr. Marchenko said. “If we help the Democrats, we anger Trump.” Mr. Giuliani has pressed the Ukrainians to investigate Mr. Biden’s younger son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, as well as the actions of the former vice president. Mr. Trump’s allies contend that Mr. Biden was trying to protect the company from prosecution when he called for Ukraine’s top prosecutor — who had investigated the company — to be fired in 2016. People familiar with Mr. Trump’s phone call with Mr. Zelensky in July said the American president repeatedly urged him to speak with Mr. Giuliani as well. Mr. Zelensky initially rebuffed Mr. Giuliani’s appeals for a meeting to press for an investigation of Mr. Biden. After that, the senior Ukrainian aide, Mr. Yermak, said he called Mr. Giuliani to convey the government’s response, which was essentially the same as the campaign promise not to interfere in the criminal justice system. Then, after the phone call on July 25 between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump, Mr. Yermak said he met with Mr. Giuliani in Madrid. In the interview in August, Mr. Yermak said he told Mr. Giuliani that the new government in Kiev would “guarantee everybody inside the country and foreign citizens and companies open and honest justice.” Mr. Yermak said he explained that, under the new administration, the justice system would be fair and open to investigating any possible crimes, but that the government would not intervene. Mr. Giuliani, however, said he came away from his interactions with Mr. Yermak over the summer “pretty confident they’re going to investigate” Mr. Biden. Now that the exchanges have become such a focal point in the congressional debate over Mr. Trump’s conduct, Mr. Zelensky and members of his administration have largely sealed their lips. Mr. Yermak and other officials have declined additional interviews, apparently wary of being caught up in the caustic American political battle. Corruption is likely to come up again at the meeting with Mr. Trump on Wednesday. As if to underscore the theme — a bread-and-butter issue for people in his country — Mr. Zelensky posted a video online before leaving for the United Nations that asked Ukrainians to call a hotline if an official solicited a bribe. “Ukraine is a very young democracy, like a child,” said Daria M. Kaleniuk, director of the Anticorruption Action Center. “The United States is an adult. But sometimes children behave as adults, and adults as children.”"
6,Ukraine’s President Says Call With Trump Was ‘Normal’,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:22:49 +0000",Alan Yuhas,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, unwillingly entangled in an impeachment inquiry in the United States, said, “I don’t want to be involved in the democratic elections of U.S.A.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/europe/zelensky-trump.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"Ukraine’s president, in his first public comments on the phone call that led to an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, said Wednesday that the call was “normal,” that “nobody pushed me,” and that he did not want to become entangled in American elections. “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved in the democratic elections of U.S.A.,” said the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to reporters with Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. “We had, I think, a good phone call,” Mr. Zelensky added, referring to a call the leaders had on July 25, which is at the center of the inquiry. “It was normal. We spoke about many things. And so, I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed — pushed me.” Mr. Trump quickly interjected, saying, “in other words, no pressure, because you know what, there was no pressure.” Mr. Zelensky became a central figure last week in the impeachment debate in the United States over whether President Trump sought help from a foreign power against one of his domestic political opponents. Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have said publicly that they believe his leading Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., should be investigated in connection with his son’s role in a Ukrainian energy company. The president has also publicly accused Mr. Biden and his son of “creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” and acknowledged raising the corruption allegations in a phone call with Mr. Zelensky on July 25. He raised allegations of corruption again on Wednesday. [The controversy has thrust Mr. Zelensky into the center of a standoff between Mr. Trump and Democrats.] The push toward opening a formal impeachment inquiry gained significant momentum after senior administration officials said that Mr. Trump personally ordered the suspension of $391 million in aid to Ukraine in the days before the call. Since Russia claimed Crimea as its territory in 2014 and started backing separatists in eastern Ukraine, the government in Kiev has received tens of millions in military aid from Western nations, including from the United States under President Barack Obama and President Trump. Mr. Trump has defended his conversation with Mr. Zelensky as “totally appropriate,” and said there had been “no quid pro quo” linking American aid to a Ukrainian investigation into Mr. Biden. Mr. Zelensky has not announced any new investigations into Mr. Biden or his son. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he said Ukraine had a new prosecutor general, “a highly professional man” who would investigate “any case he considers and deems appropriate.” “We have an independent country,” he said. “I can’t push anyone.” Earlier on Wednesday, with the impeachment inquiry now rocketing to the center of attention in the United States, Mr. Zelensky did not make any references to Mr. Trump or even the American military aid for Ukraine in its war with Russian-backed separatists — a central element in the inquiry. Instead, in his address to the annual General Assembly session at the United Nations, Mr. Zelensky spoke at length about the toll of wars around the world, and especially in Ukraine. “Nobody will feel safe while Russia is waging war against Ukraine in the center of Europe,” he said. “The thought that this has nothing to do with you or will never touch your interests will be fatal.” Mr. Zelensky also insisted that every nation had a stake in conflicts that seemed distant. “We cannot think globally while turning a blind eye to small things, or as some may believe, to trifles,” he continued. “That is how the foundation of two world wars was laid down, and as a result millions of human lives have paid the price for negligence, silence, inaction or an unwillingness to relinquish our own ambitions.” Mr. Zelensky, 41, vaulted into Ukraine’s highest office this year with an unconventional campaign and an even more unconventional background: He starred in a popular TV comedy about a schoolteacher who is unexpectedly elected president after a rant about corruption is posted online. The actor adopted the name of the show, “Servant of the People,” for the name of a new political party, and the platform of his character — taking on Ukraine’s corrupt oligarchs — for a campaign platform. He proceeded to bowl over a crowded field of candidates, most of them career politicians, and roundly defeated the incumbent president, the billionaire President Petro O. Poroshenko, in the final election. Yet Mr. Zelensky took office in a country sapped by decades of corruption and more than five years of war against Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine’s east. He has put those two issues at the top of his agenda, and this month orchestrated a prisoner swap with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in what Mr. Zelensky called “the first step to end the war.” On Tuesday night, Mr. Zelensky said in a statement that he planned to invite Mr. Trump to Ukraine. “I expect us to have awesome relations with the United States,” he said in the statement. “I expect us to invite Donald Trump to visit Ukraine. I would like the leaders of the countries to come and see how great Ukraine is. One should believe not the words, but the eyes.” He added that “the most important thing” was that “nobody forgets about Ukraine.”"
7,Journalist Behind France’s #MeToo Movement Loses Defamation Case,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:46:42 +0000",Aurelien Breeden,"Sandra Muller started #BalanceTonPorc, or #ExposeYourPig, when she accused a former TV executive of making crude comments to her. He admitted the comments but denied harassment.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/europe/france-sandra-muller-verdict.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"PARIS — A court in Paris found on Wednesday that the journalist who had started France’s equivalent of the #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment defamed a former television executive she had accused of making salacious and humiliating advances to her. The court ordered the journalist, Sandra Muller, who is based in New York, to pay 15,000 euros, or about $16,500, in damages to Eric Brion, a media consultant and former executive at the public broadcaster France Télévisions and the horse-racing channel Equidia. She was also ordered to pay €5,000, about $5,500, to cover his legal fees, and remove Twitter posts mentioning Mr. Brion. “She surpassed the acceptable limits of freedom of expression, as her comments descended into a personal attack,” the court said in its ruling. Ms. Muller started #BalanceTonPorc, or #ExposeYourPig, in 2017 with a series of Twitter posts recounting her experiences with Mr. Brion. She said that during a social event at a television festival in Cannes, on the French Riviera, Mr. Brion told her: “You have big breasts. You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night.” In her posts, she also encouraged women to speak out against sexual harassment, and tens of thousands of them adopted the #BalanceTonPorc hashtag, spurring a wider discussion on gender relations and sexual norms in France. Unlike many of the other women who came forward, however, Ms. Muller named the man she was accusing of harassment. Months after Ms. Muller’s Twitter posts, Mr. Brion sued for defamation. He never denied making inappropriate and crude comments, but said that Ms. Muller had been wrong to characterize them as sexual harassment and to tie his case to that of Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul accused by multiple women of decades of abuse, including rape. Mr. Brion argued that his comments had been made once and under the influence of alcohol, and added that he had apologized soon afterward. He also stressed that although he knew Ms. Muller professionally — she works for an online news site that covers the media — they did not work together. The court in Paris agreed with Mr. Brion, ruling that Ms. Muller lacked a sufficient “factual basis” to accuse him of sexual harassment and that she had failed to show “caution” in her posts on Twitter, using the term “pig,” tying Mr. Brion to Mr. Weinstein and exposing him to “social reprobation.” Ms. Muller called the verdict “disappointing” and “incomprehensible.” She and her lawyer said they would appeal, which temporarily suspends the fines and other court orders. “This ruling takes nothing away from the fact that women are now speaking freely, that you need to continue to speak, that you need to continue to report reprehensible acts, whatever they are,” Ms. Muller said at a news conference held at her lawyer’s office in Paris. “I will continue to fight on these issues every day.” In 2017, Time magazine named Ms. Muller as one of the “silence breakers,” the women who had come forward to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment and assault, in choosing them collectively as Person of the Year. In France, however, the #MeToo movement exposed a sharp social and cultural divide. Last year, more than 100 women, including  the actress Catherine Deneuve, signed a public letter denouncing the movement and arguing that its supporters and those of #BalanceTonPorc had created a totalitarian climate by publicly prosecuting private experiences. In the #BalanceTonPorc case, Mr. Brion testified at a hearing in May 2019 that he had suffered a “descent into hell” after Ms. Muller’s posts on Twitter, adding that he was still taking medication for depression and that he had lost several business and job opportunities. Mr. Brion told the CNews television channel on Wednesday, “My trial happened on Twitter, on Facebook, and it’s impossible to defend yourself.” “You can’t destroy a man’s life,” he added, “just because one evening he spoke to you inappropriately, without going any further.” Ms. Muller and her lawyers rejected the defamation accusations, noting that Mr. Brion had acknowledged making the comments and arguing that the court’s ruling would discourage women from coming forward. Francis Szpiner, Ms. Muller’s lawyer, said that the fines were “punitive” for someone with her level of income. “Had one wanted to ensure that women not speak out, that women stay silent, one wouldn’t have proceeded any other way,” Mr. Szpiner said at the news conference. But Nicolas Bénoit, one of Mr. Brion’s lawyers, said the court had ruled against Ms. Muller, not the movement she helped create. “Did Ms. Muller give proof of the truth of her accusations? The answer is no,” Mr. Bénoit said in a phone interview. “Does the Balance Ton Porc movement — a movement that is in the public interest — justify, even a little bit, this mistake? The court says no.”"
8,"South Korean Clinic Performed Abortion on Wrong Woman, Police Say","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 21:10:17 +0000",Choe Sang-Hun,The police said they planned to ask prosecutors to indict the clinic’s doctor and a nurse on charges of inflicting accidental injury.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/asia/south-korea-abortion-mistake.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"SEOUL, South Korea — An expectant mother who visited a medical clinic in Seoul, South Korea, last month to receive a nutritional shot woke up hours later to learn she had mistakenly been given an abortion, the police said on Wednesday. The police said they planned to ask prosecutors to indict the clinic’s doctor and a nurse on charges of inflicting accidental injury. The staff, the police said, administered anesthesia and performed an abortion on the woman, a Vietnamese citizen, who was six weeks pregnant. The police did not identify the woman, the doctor or the nurse. There have been no arrests. An Chan-su, a police investigator, declined to confirm local news reports that the accidental abortion took place after medical charts were mixed up and the woman was mistaken for another patient seeking an abortion after a miscarriage. In a landmark ruling in April, South Korea’s Constitutional Court struck down a 66-year-old law that made performing an abortion a crime punishable by up to two years in prison, and gave Parliament until the end of 2020 to revise the law. Under the current law, a woman who undergoes an abortion can be punished with up to a year in prison or a fine of up to 2 million won, about $1,670. Abortions are legal in exceptional circumstances, including rape, incest or when a woman’s health is at risk. Doctors, however, can be charged only when they perform abortions intentionally, not by mistake, the police said. The current law also does not consider a fetus a human being so the charge of accidental homicide cannot be applied in this case, they said. Despite the ban on abortion, the practice is widespread and the law is rarely enforced. In 2017 alone, 49,700 abortions took place, nearly 94 percent of them illegally, according to estimates released by the government-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. The actual number could be much higher, according to civic groups. Between 2012 and 2017, just 80 women or doctors went to trial for their involvement in abortions, and only one of them served time in prison, with the rest receiving fines or suspended jail terms, according to court data. In its ruling, the Constitutional Court called the anti-abortion law “an unconstitutional restriction that violates a pregnant woman’s right to choose.” But it left it to Parliament to decide whether to restrict abortions in the late stages of a pregnancy."
9,Trump Attracts Central American Support for Hard-Line Migration Policies,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 22:52:22 +0000",Kirk Semple,"The Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, has courted the White House. And on Wednesday, Honduras signed an agreement to help thwart asylum seekers from entering the United States.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/americas/trump-salvador-migration.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"MEXICO CITY — When President Trump sat down with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador in New York City on Wednesday, the American leader may have seen some of himself reflected in his Central American counterpart. Both have fashioned themselves as iconoclasts, upending political conventions. Both are social media fanatics: Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bukele is accused by his critics of governing by tweet. And the two are now working in lock step to advance one of the American president’s top priorities. With a recent series of policy decisions, Mr. Bukele has joined the Trump administration in moving to curb illegal migration to the United States. The Trump administration on Wednesday received additional Central American support for its hard-line migration policies when Honduras signed an agreement with the United States that is intended to thwart asylum-seekers traveling through the region from entering the United States. That pact follows similar agreements that the United States has signed with El Salvador and Guatemala. Mr. Bukele’s cooperation with the Trump administration on migration enforcement is part of a broader effort by the Salvadoran leader to recast relations with the United States, El Salvador’s largest trading partner and home to more than 1.4 million Salvadoran immigrants. But it also comes packaged with Salvadoran expectations: Among other items on his wish list, Mr. Bukele wants the Trump administration to promote investment in El Salvador and continue a humanitarian program that protects nearly 200,000 Salvadorans living in the United States. “What I would say is truly different is this effort to court the United States as a true partner,” said Cynthia J. Arnson, director of the Latin American Program at the Wilson Center in Washington. “El Salvador has a lot riding on maintaining a positive relationship with the United States.” The brief meeting between the two presidents on Wednesday afternoon was accompanied by an appearance before the press during which the men praised each other but took no questions. “For us, the United States is not only a partner and an ally, but also a friend,” said Mr. Bukele, 38, who was dressed in a suit but, as is his custom, wore no tie. “We’re hoping that this meeting will only strengthen our relationship even more, and I think it will because, you know, President Trump is very nice and cool, and I’m nice and cool, too. We both use Twitter a lot, so, you know, we’ll get along.” It was the first bilateral meeting between the two men since Mr. Bukele took office in June. Mr. Bukele, a businessman and former mayor of the capital city, San Salvador, has tried to reposition El Salvador in the eyes of the American administration since his election in February. He has disavowed his predecessors’ embrace of socialist strongmen in the region, he has earnestly tried to sell El Salvador as a friendly place for American investment and he has sought to distance his nation from Guatemala and Honduras, two troubled neighbors with which El Salvador is often lumped. More than anything, he has been openly solicitous of Mr. Trump’s attention and has refrained from criticizing the American administration, analysts said. Ana Quintana, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said that during the previous two presidential administrations in El Salvador, “The partnership was really not there at the highest levels, things were quite tense. And he’s really shifted that, and the United States has reciprocated.” The Bukele administration said the presidents discussed migration, security and investment opportunities in El Salvador, including the development of the tourism sector. They also talked about the fate of Salvadorans who have been living in the United States under the terms of a humanitarian program known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S. Last Friday, their administrations signed an agreement that would allow the United States to send back asylum-seekers who had crossed El Salvador on their journey to the American border. The Trump administration, as part of its campaign to curb illegal migration and reduce pressure on the American asylum system, has been pushing Latin American countries to sign such pacts. The government of Honduras was the latest to do so, signing a similar agreement on Wednesday that would require migrants to apply for and be denied protections in that Central American country before being able to petition for asylum in the United States, according to a senior Homeland Security official. The deal with Honduras comes just days before the brother of President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras is set to stand trial on federal drug trafficking charges in Manhattan. The trial threatens to ensnare the Honduran president in a broadening federal investigation into the ties between drug traffickers and Honduran government officials. Guatemala has also signed a similar accord, though the deal has not been ratified by the Guatemalan legislature and, like the other two, has not yet been implemented. The United States-El Salvador deal was the latest indication of Mr. Bukele’s willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration in its effort to reduce migration. This month, his administration deployed hundreds of security forces and immigration agents to its border to help curb the flow of migrants bound for Mexico and the United States. And Mr. Bukele, who is enjoying sky-high approval ratings that hover around 90 percent, has blamed El Salvador and its myriad problems — including violence, public corruption and the lack of employment opportunities — for large-scale emigration. While the Bukele administration has insisted that its approach toward the United States represents a fundamental shift — Mr. Bukele’s foreign minister, Alexandra Hill, called it “a complete 180” last week — some analysts in El Salvador and the United States say the change has been mostly tonal. Among Mr. Bukele’s efforts to break with the past was his decision to publicly criticize President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. And in one of his first public appearances after being elected, he delivered a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. But the underpinnings of the bilateral relationship — including trade and cooperation in the fight against transnational crime — have not significantly changed, analysts said. “Certainly the perception change has been huge,” said Geoff Thale, vice president for programs at the Washington Office on Latin America. But, he added, “there are ties that, no matter how different the governments are, bind them together.” There is a lot at stake for El Salvador. Its enormous diaspora in the United States sends billions of dollars a year back to El Salvador in remittances, helping to prop up the Salvadoran economy. Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans have been allowed to live and work in the United States under the T.P.S. program since a devastating pair of earthquakes in their country in 2001. Mr. Trump has sought to end those protections, which would force those Salvadorans to return home. The Bukele administration, which has hoped to persuade the White House to extend the program for Salvadorans, said in a statement that Mr. Trump agreed to ask administration officials to “find a way out” for the Salvadorans in T.P.S. Mr. Bukele has also sought to highlight El Salvador as a good place for American investment, arguing that he has made gains against drug trafficking and other crimes and seeking to draw a distinction between his country and Guatemala and Honduras. “At the end of the day, Bukele wants to attract tourism and wants to attract investment, and being seen as the most U.S.-friendly, pro-business country in Central America helps him in that goal,” said Tim Muth, founder of El Salvador Perspectives, a blog that closely tracks El Salvador politics. “He’s moving very quickly to try to change the public perception of the country.”"
10,A Blood-Red Sky: Fires Leave a Million Indonesians Gasping,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 03:55:15 +0000","Richard C. Paddock, Muktita Suhartono and Ulet Ifansasti",Wildfires burning across Indonesia have created respiratory problems for nearly a million people.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/asia/indonesia-red-sky-fires.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Nearly 2,000 wildfires are burning across Indonesia, turning the sky blood red over central Sumatra and creating dense clouds of smoke that have caused respiratory problems for nearly a million people.  Dense white smoke filled the air across Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo, known as Kalimantan, the two areas that were hardest hit. Many of the fires were set deliberately to clear land for plantations that produce palm oil and wood pulp for making paper, the authorities said. The blazes, which tore through sensitive rain forests where dozens of endangered species live, have drawn comparisons to the wildfires in the Amazon basin that have destroyed more than 2 million acres. By Wednesday, rain had brought some relief in reducing the number of Indonesian hot spots, which include burning jungles and smoldering peatfields, to fewer than 1,800. The count was more than 3,300 two days earlier. Towering flames devoured trees and brush in what was once dense jungle, leaving behind a blackened wasteland of charred stumps and bushes.  The fires are an annual phenomenon as large plantations and small farmers use the age-old slash-and-burn method during the dry season to open new land for planting.  Neighboring Singapore and Malaysia have complained for decades about the smoke that drifts over from Sumatra and Kalimantan and chokes the region every year at this time. This year’s fires are the worst in Indonesia since 2015. Officials estimate that the fires have burned more than 800,000 acres. The smoke and flames threaten three species of endangered orangutans that are found only on Sumatra and Borneo. Even though the fires are predictable, Indonesia is woefully unprepared to combat the blazes, which often start in remote and inaccessible areas. Slash-and-burn farming, employed for thousands of years in the region, is illegal in Indonesia, but few people are ever prosecuted. The environmental group Greenpeace criticized the government on Tuesday for not taking action against those companies that set fires to clear land for planting. In a report analyzing the fires of the last four years, the group said that none of the 10 companies with the largest areas of burned land faced serious civil or administrative sanctions and that no palm oil company had lost its license. This year’s fires are occurring in many of the same areas as in past years, the group said. Greenpeace urged Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, to strip companies of their licenses immediately if there are fires burning on their land. “Stopping this recurring fire crisis should have been at the top of the government’s agenda since 2015,” said Kiki Taufik, the global head of Greenpeace Indonesia’s forests campaign. “But our findings show the reality: empty words and weak and inconsistent law enforcement against companies.” Officials said that 14 companies are under investigation for allowing the fires to spread on their land and that more than 300 people have been identified as suspects. The sky turned deep red last week and over the weekend in the central Sumatran province of Jambi. Pictures and videos of the eerie scene were circulated widely on social media. Some described it as “hellish.” The red color was caused by “mie scattering,” officials said, a phenomenon in which the sun shines on a large number of microscopic smoke particles, which match the wavelength for the color red. “This is not Mars. This is Jambi,” wrote the Twitter user Zuni Shofi Yatun Nisa, who posted a video showing the red sky over her province. “We humans need clean air, not smoke.” Respiratory problems have affected 920,000 people in the six provinces in Sumatra and Kalimantan where the fires have been the worst, according to the disaster management agency. Most affected are the young, the elderly and the sick. One civil society group, the Muhammadiyah Disaster Management Center, operates two cars in Kalimantan that bring oxygen to people in the fire zone who are unable to leave or cannot afford to evacuate. “This is where we have a different approach with the government,” said the group’s vice secretary, Abdoel Malik. “The government tends to tell people to go to the local clinics for treatment” instead of the government “going to them.” He said this was the fifth year that the organization had provided the oxygen service and that he was shocked by the magnitude of this year’s fires. “No one expected that it would be this big,” he said. “All the humanitarian organizations are shocked. None of them were prepared for this.”"
11,"In a First for Australia, the Capital Legalizes Recreational Marijuana","Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:00:21 +0000",Isabella Kwai,"The move echoed efforts in the United States, where some states have legalized recreational use of marijuana even as it has remained illegal under federal law.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/australia/marijuana-cannabis-recreational-legal.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"SYDNEY, Australia — Australia’s capital on Wednesday became the first jurisdiction in the country to legalize the recreational possession and cultivation of marijuana, a move that runs counter to federal laws that can carry prison terms for personal use of the drug. Passage of the measure, which came after months of debate over policy, legal and health issues, echoed efforts in the United States, where more than 10 states have legalized recreational use of marijuana even as it remains illegal under federal law. The new law in the Australian Capital Territory, which encompasses the capital city, Canberra, allows residents over 18 to possess up to 50 grams of dried marijuana and grow two plants per person or four per household at a time. Supplying the drug to other people remains illegal. “The passage of this legislation is an Australian first,” Michael Pettersson, a Labor Party lawmaker who was a driving force behind the bill, said in a statement. “It will work to reduce the harm of drugs in our community by reducing the stigma of drug use and encouraging people to seek help without fear of arrest.” Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit recreational drug in Australia. In a 2016 government survey, about a third of Australians over age 14 said they had used it, with about 10 percent saying they had used it in the previous 12 months. Australia approved  the use of marijuana for medical purposes in 2016, but the country has not moved in the direction of the small number of other countries, like Canada, that have legalized recreational use on a national level. Before the Australian Capital Territory passed its legalization measure, possession of small amounts of marijuana had been decriminalized there and in a few other jurisdictions, giving police officers the discretion to issue fines instead of making arrests. In other jurisdictions, possession is still a crime, though warnings are usually given to first-time offenders. Under federal law, recreational possession carries a potential penalty of two years in prison. The Australian Capital Territory legislation provides a legal defense under local law for adults who possess marijuana but does not remove the risk of arrest under federal law, said Gordon Ramsay, the territory’s attorney general. The final legislation, which is likely to go into effect at the end of January, included a number of amendments. They restrict cultivation of plants to private property, make it an offense to smoke near minors, require proper storage away from children and add a separate weight limit of 150 grams, or about five ounces, for freshly cultivated marijuana. The federal government has moved to overturn major legislative changes by states or territories in the past, though it is unclear whether it will do so in this case. In 2013, it successfully argued in court to reverse legislation in the capital territory that allowed same-sex couples to marry. The federal government then legalized same-sex marriage in 2017. Opponents of the capital’s cannabis bill said that while the amendments would limit some of the harm, it would lead to higher consumption of marijuana, which some researchers have linked to an increased risk of psychosis, and more cases of people driving under the influence. The legislation could lead to a “whole bunch of perverse outcomes,” Jeremy Hanson, the attorney general for the conservative-leaning Liberal Party, said during debate on the measure. “The current laws as they work are effective.” The capital branch of the Australian Medical Association said that use of marijuana could lead to chronic health problems, but that the risk was low and that those who used the drug occasionally were unlikely to be affected, according to a government inquiry into the issue. “It doesn’t appear to be the sort of legislation or policy change that results in the sky falling down,” said Dr. David Caldicott, an emergency medicine consultant who supported the bill. The nation’s capital has been at the forefront of drug reform policy in the past, including testing pills at festivals, Dr. Caldicott added. “Rather than causing a shift in cannabis consumption in Australia,” he said, “it might create a broader conversational environment” around the policies governing it. The Australian Capital Territory police said in a statement that they would coordinate with the local government and other agencies to carry out the new legislation, including working out how it intersects with federal law."
12,"Giant Glacier in the Alps Is in Danger of Collapse, Experts Warn","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 21:24:33 +0000",Iliana Magra,The Italian authorities have closed two roads and evacuated mountain huts after researchers found a gaping crack in an ice mass on the Mont Blanc massif.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/europe/glacier-italy-climate-change.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"A giant section of a glacier on the Mont Blanc massif in the Alps is in danger of collapsing, experts warned on Wednesday, prompting the precautionary closing of two roads and the evacuation of mountain huts in northwestern Italy. A block of about nine million cubic feet of the Planpincieux Glacier on the peak of Grandes Jorasses, a mountain on the French-Italian border, has splintered and could give way, according to Daniele Giordan, a geologist working for the Italian National Research Council. Dr. Giordan, who is part of a team that has been monitoring the glacier since 2013, said by phone on Wednesday that though a fracture in the glacier was common after the warm summer months, the crack detected this time was alarmingly wide. “This year, we noticed again the presence of a large crevasse,” he said. “The opening of this crevasse can create the collapse of a very large block.” Dr. Giordan added, “A collapse that big could reach the bottom of the valley” in the form of a barreling ice avalanche that could endanger anybody on the mountain or on the road at the bottom of the valley. Stefano Miserocchi, the mayor of the Italian resort town of Courmayeur, said he had issued a pre-emptive order to keep the area, which is popular with hikers, clear for the time being. He added that the area under direct threat was uninhabited but that the authorities had nonetheless blocked part of the road connecting Courmayeur to the small settlement of Planpincieux for most of the day and night. Though the risk of collapse is high, experts cannot be sure when it might happen. “The most important element now is temperature,” said Dr. Giordan, the geologist. A cold October could reduce the movement of the lower part of the glacier, he added, allowing the crevasse to close. Dr. Giordan noted that such crevasses had happened before but that the volume of the block in peril had never been as big in the past. Mr. Miserocchi, the Courmayeur mayor, said that climate change was “bringing changes and requires protection measures.” “It’s a situation we have to live with and handle correctly,” he added. Dr. Giordan said that the formation of the crevasse was not directly connected to climate change, but acknowledged that rising temperatures probably increased the frequency of such phenomena by making the glacier less stable. About 10 percent of the Earth’s land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets, according to a major United Nations report published on Wednesday that blames global warming for massive losses from ice sheets and glaciers in the past few decades. “Many glaciers are projected to disappear regardless of future emissions,” the report said. This week, dozens of people participated in a funeral march for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, while a study released in April by the European Geosciences Union, a nonprofit research organization, said that, “under strong warming, the Alps would be mostly ice-free by 2100.” Daniel Farinotti, one of the authors of the study, said in a statement at the time, “Glaciers in the European Alps and their recent evolution are some of the clearest indicators of the ongoing changes in climate.” “The future of these glaciers is indeed at risk, but there is still a possibility to limit their future losses,” he added."
13,Pakistan Leader Will Urge U.N. Intervention in Kashmir,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 21:01:02 +0000",Eric Nagourney,"Prime Minister Imran Khan denounced India’s military clampdown in Muslim-majority Kashmir, attributing it to a “racist, fascist, Hindu supremacist mind-set.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/asia/imran-khan-kashmir-india.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"Pakistan’s leader, lamenting what he said was the world’s indifference to civilian suffering in Kashmir, on Wednesday condemned India’s military clampdown there and said he would appeal to the United Nations for help. “They do not understand that this can go horribly wrong,” the Pakistani leader, Prime Minister Imran Khan, said.  In August, the Indian government revoked the longstanding autonomy of the contested border region and arrested thousands of Kashmiris. It cut off phone and internet service to millions of people and imposed a curfew. The move raised tensions between India and Pakistan, which have long been at odds over the restive region. A million troops have squared off along the disputed border, one of Asia’s tensest flash points and the source of two previous wars between the two countries.  On Wednesday, meeting with editors of The New York Times, Mr. Khan said he would ask the United Nations to intervene when he addressed the General Assembly on Friday. “If the U.N. doesn’t speak about it, who is going to speak about it?” Mr. Khan said. In revoking a 70-year-old legal provision that had given autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and buttressing its military presence there, Indian officials said the goal was to establish peace and prosperity.  Pakistan has a history of funding separatist militants in Kashmir. But the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, rose to power with an unvarnished appeal to Hindu nationalists, who have long wanted access and sway in Muslim-majority Kashmir. Over the past two months, Indian forces have rounded up at least 2,000 Kashmiris, including elected representatives, local officials say. Mr. Khan said India was behaving irrationally — and against its own longer-term interests.  “Arrogance,” he said, “stops people from being rational.” Mr. Khan said he would ask the United Nations to step in, warning that it was too risky to allow tensions to escalate between India and Pakistan, both of which have nuclear weapons. “This is the U.N.'s job,” he said, adding: “They have to intervene, send observers there.”  That may be a long shot.  “I can’t imagine India agreeing to it, and the U.N. isn’t going to intervene over India’s objections,” said Laurel Miller, director of the Asia Program at the International Crisis Group. The Kashmiris are not the only Muslim group to be oppressed as the world looks away. The Rohingya in Myanmar and the Uighurs in China have also been brutalized. But in Kashmir, part of the problem, Ms. Miller said, may not be the message but the messenger. “There is a history, and an existing reality, of Pakistani tolerance of and support for militant groups,” she said. Ms. Miller, like Mr. Khan, said some nations might be reluctant to press the issue because they don’t want to jeopardize their relationship with India, a major economic market. That could change, she said, if widespread violence breaks out in Kashmir. Mr. Khan said he feared that was exactly what would happen. “This is very dangerous,” he said, “because people don’t realize where it’s headed. It’s going to be a massacre, the moment they lift the curfew.” The Pakistani leader said he was not optimistic that he would accomplish anything in his speech to the United Nations, at least not in the near term. “But at least the world will be aware,” he said. “Because I fear an impending genocide.”"
14,Israel’s First Prime Minister Was Complicated. So Is This Book About His Life.,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:41:38 +0000",Francine Klagsbrun,"In “A State at Any Cost,” a controversial historian explores David Ben-Gurion’s single-minded dream of building a Jewish state in Palestine.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/books/review/a-state-at-any-cost-tom-segev.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"A STATE AT ANY COSTThe Life of David Ben-GurionBy Tom Segev On the eve of the establishment of the state of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, who had worked tirelessly toward this goal, suddenly sought to postpone independence. He knew neighboring Arab countries were poised to invade and he feared his underground army wasn’t prepared to fight; so, at a nighttime meeting with Lord Chancellor Sir William Jowitt, Ben-Gurion proposed that the British remain in charge of Palestine for another five to 10 years while working to increase Jewish immigration. Nothing came of this proposal and, on Nov. 29, 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. Full-scale fighting broke out six months later. Ben-Gurion’s 11th-hour meeting is one of the little-known facts revealed by the Israeli historian Tom Segev in his deeply researched, engrossing and, in some respects, controversial biography, “A State at Any Cost.” Segev has written several books on Israel, and he joins other noted experts who have mined newly released archival sources to re-examine the life and legacy of the country’s first prime minister. The timing makes sense: As Israel has transformed itself from a small, struggling society into a high-tech player on the global stage, its people have become increasingly interested in the ideals that first guided it and the roots of problems that still confound it. And, like America’s founding fathers, David Ben-Gurion was the embodiment of his nation’s complicated beginnings. Born David Yosef Gruen in the Polish town of Plonsk in 1886, Ben-Gurion said he knew by the age of 3 that his home would be in the land of Israel. Hyperbolic as this sounds, his claim helps explain his lifelong mission to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. It also reflects the atmosphere in his home, where Ben-Gurion’s father was one of the town’s first Zionist activists. Even so, as a young man he felt directionless: He moved to Warsaw, was rejected by a technological college there, and eventually became so despondent that he wrote a friend, “I can’t find any interest in living anymore.” Ben-Gurion found himself after arriving in Palestine in 1906 at the age of 20. He would later recall this period with pride, despite having realized fairly quickly that he was not cut out for the field work he was doing on a farm. Politics soon became his métier and the road to fulfilling his Zionist aspirations. To prepare himself, Ben-Gurion traveled to Turkey to study law along with his friend Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who later became Israel’s second president. After their studies were cut short by World War I, they eventually headed to New York City, where Ben-Gurion met and married Pauline (Paula) Moonweis. Their union was not without its problems — Ben-Gurion had several lengthy affairs and was a distant father to their three children — but the two remained together for 50 years. By the late 1930s, Ben-Gurion and his socialist labor party had gained power not only in Palestine, but over the worldwide Zionist movement as well. Their goal was to establish a state with a Jewish majority in the biblical land of Israel. But in 1937, when the British Peel Commission recommended dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, Ben-Gurion responded with “burning enthusiasm,” despite the tiny area allotted to the Jews. As he told colleagues, the fact of having a state was more important than its borders; besides, “borders are not forever.” The Peel plan fell through, but 10 years later Ben-Gurion accepted the partition resolution from the United Nations. Although he made attempts at peace with the Palestinian Arabs, Ben-Gurion was pessimistic about ever achieving it. Long before the state existed, he met with a respected Muslim jurist, Musa al-Alami, whom he assured that the Zionists had come to develop Palestine for all its inhabitants. Alami said he preferred to leave the land poor and desolate for another century until the Arabs could develop it themselves. Ben-Gurion repeated this story again and again as proof of the futility of seeking agreement. At most, Segev writes, Ben-Gurion believed the conflict “could be managed,” not resolved. Segev is best when probing the human side of the complex leader. Often brusque in manner, outwardly self-assured and iron-willed, Ben-Gurion poured his innermost emotions into his diaries and letters. “I am a solitary and lonely man,” he wrote to Paula. “There are moments in which my heart is boiling and torn, and bitter and difficult questions plague me.” He was periodically ill and bedridden, frequently unable to sleep. As Segev’s title suggests, the price of creating the state was steep — taking a personal toll on Ben-Gurion while costing thousands of people their lives and homes. Where “A State at Any Cost” falls short is when the author injects his own ideology into the events of Ben-Gurion’s life. Segev has been associated with revisionist historians, known in the past as “new historians,” who challenge Israel’s founding narratives — sometimes with bracing reality, often with controversial positions disputed by other experts. For example: Ben-Gurion and comrades who arrived in Palestine in the early 1900s embraced the idea of “Hebrew labor.” The term is widely understood to refer to manual work by Jews, rejecting centuries of work Jews did in the Diaspora as merchants and shopkeepers. The idea was to create “new Jews” who would cultivate the soil with their own hands. However, Segev defines the term differently. In his book, “Hebrew labor” is regarded not as a pioneer ideal, but as a means for Jews to displace Arab workers and control the labor market. He also makes a questionable connection between “Hebrew labor” and the flight of Arabs from their villages during the 1948 war, as though there were a planned and systematic scheme to push out the Arabs. In reality, the exodus of the Arabs from the designated Jewish state — the origin of the Palestinian refugee problem — is in itself a hotly debated subject. Scholars disagree about how many villagers left of their own accord and how many were expelled by Israeli commanders. There is no evidence that Ben-Gurion gave a central order to evacuate them all. He seemed surprised at first by the emptying villages, only later regarding the Arab flight as a boon to the military. In 1963, David Ben-Gurion retired as prime minister. He spent most of the next decade in Sde Boker, a settlement in the Negev Desert. There, in the study of his two-bedroom house surrounded by almost a thousand books, he devoted much of the rest of his life to writing his memoirs. Through the drama of his life, and despite his failings — both personal and political — Ben-Gurion emerges in Segev’s book as a man of vision and integrity. These are qualities that Israelis, like the rest of us, long for in today’s leaders."
15,Countdown Begins in Israel on Efforts to Forge a Power-Sharing Deal,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:14:21 +0000",Isabel Kershner,President Reuven Rivlin has urged Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz to try to form a unity government to extricate the country from political stalemate.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/world/middleeast/israel-gantz-netanyahu.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"JERUSALEM — Update: On Wednesday, President Rivlin nominated Prime Minister Netanyahu to try to form Israel’s next government. President Reuven Rivlin of Israel was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief opponent, Benny Gantz, on Wednesday to assess their chances of forging a power-sharing agreement after the official results of the country’s inconclusive election were finalized. Mr. Rivlin has a week to nominate a prime minister-elect who will get the first chance at trying to form a viable coalition, though he could make a choice sooner. The final results released by the Central Elections Committee on Wednesday amended the preliminary count and gave Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party an extra parliamentary seat, raising its representation from 31 to 32. Mr. Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party has 33. But the adjustment did nothing to break the political deadlock caused by the outcome of the Sept. 17 election, Israel’s second in five months. That has thrust Mr. Rivlin, the president, into the spotlight. He has urged Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz to try to form a government of national unity including both their parties, saying that such an outcome was what the election results demanded and that it would extricate Israel from the political stalemate, avoiding a possible third vote. “On the one hand, these elections demonstrated our vibrant democracy, but on the other, highlighted the division between us,” Mr. Rivlin told foreign diplomats on Wednesday at a reception to mark the Jewish New Year. “Now we must ask ourselves: How can we learn from the past? How can we heal the divisions of the present? And how can we build a shared future?” Though the Israeli presidency is a mostly ceremonial role, Mr. Rivlin gets to choose who will get the first shot at forming a government. That privilege traditionally goes to the candidate who heads either the largest party or the largest bloc. With the sides essentially tied, Mr. Rivlin can use his discretion based on who he thinks has the best chance of forming a coalition. If Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz came to an agreement on their own, Mr. Rivlin would go along with that. Though Blue and White edged ahead of Likud, Mr. Netanyahu’s broader right-wing, religious bloc of allied parties ended up slightly stronger than Mr. Gantz’s center-left bloc, with 55 seats to 54. With one hard-line but secular party, Avigdor Liberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu, still refusing to back either candidate, neither group commands enough support to create a coalition with a majority in the 120-seat Parliament. Negotiators from Blue and White and from Likud met for the first time on Tuesday, under pressure from Mr. Rivlin. Little was revealed, but what was did not sound propitious. In brief statements after the talks, both sides noted an early sticking point. The top Likud negotiator, Yariv Levin, said that he was representing all 55 members of the right-wing, religious bloc. But Blue and White’s negotiator, Yoram Turbowicz, countered that from his perspective, Mr. Levin was only representing Likud and Mr. Netanyahu. Another major sticking point in reaching a unity agreement will be who would serve first as prime minister in any rotation arrangement. In a similar situation in the 1980s, President Chaim Herzog successfully brokered a unity government agreement between Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, according to which Mr. Peres served the first two years as prime minister and Mr. Shamir the following two. The negotiations took a month. The current situation is muddied because Mr. Netanyahu is facing an indictment in three corruption cases and could soon be charged. If that happened, he would be able to stay in office only if he were prime minister. In a lesser role, such as an ordinary minister in the government, he would have to resign if charged. A prime minister-elect has 28 days to try to put together a coalition, with the president able to grant a discretionary 14-day extension. In the case of failure, the mantle is passed to another candidate. After the April election, Mr. Netanyahu emerged in a stronger position than Mr. Gantz, but ultimately, after Mr. Liberman abandoned him, he could only muster the support of 60 lawmakers, one short of the required 61. Instead of allowing Mr. Gantz an opportunity to try to form a coalition, Mr. Netanyahu moved swiftly to dissolve Parliament, forcing a do-over vote. Analysts have been parsing the pros and cons of being the first to be appointed with the task of forming a government, suggesting that Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz might each prefer the other to try first in the hope that any such effort would fail. Under that line of thinking, it might be easier on a second time around to persuade potential partners or defectors from other parties to cooperate to prevent a third election. But there is also risk involved. “If you go first you can use all the tools and be the first to try everything,” said Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Israel Democracy Institute and at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Going second means sitting and waiting, he noted. “It’s a very dangerous game,” he said."
16,‘I Vow to Tread Lightly’,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 09:00:18 +0000",Elaine Glusac,Tourism “pledges” to promote respect for local customs and natural resources have proliferated in recent years. But whether these largely voluntary vows have changed behaviors is hard to track.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/travel/tourism-pledges-sustainable-travel.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"When Lynn Englum of New York City visited the Republic of Palau in February as part of a travel project exploring places imperiled by climate change, she received an elaborate stamp in her passport. The full-page stamp featured a 59-word promise, addressed to the “Children of Palau,” to “tread lightly, act kindly and explore mindfully.” She was required to sign the stamp, known as the Palau Pledge and adopted in December 2017, as a condition of entry designed to promote respect for the country’s natural resources. Though the procedure was rushed, given the immigration lines, Ms. Englum, 37, later wrote in an email, that “it did make me aware that Palau is very concerned about its environment, especially for the sake of future generations, and they are asking me to be equally concerned as I visit their country.” In recent years, tourism pledges have proliferated as destinations from Iceland to Hawaii seek to train travelers in sustainable practices and cultural awareness. Largely voluntary, these multipoint pledges cover a range of responsible travel vows, from not littering on trails to parking legally, minding safety cautions and respecting local communities. Iceland claims to be the first country to introduce one. In June 2017, the popular destination launched the Icelandic Pledge through an online portal, with vows including “I will take photos to die for, without dying for them.” and “When nature calls, I won’t answer the call on nature.” Tourists can sign the pledge online at InspiredbyIceland.com, a tourism site, after which they are encouraged to share it on Facebook. “Tourism is growing in the world and it is important that people understand how to behave in new and unfamiliar places,” wrote Inga Hlín Pálsdóttir, the director of Visit Iceland, in an email. She also noted that destinations should make efforts to make this information accessible. Educating travelers in local ways isn’t exactly new; in recent decades Americans were often advised to leave their baseball caps at home to better assimilate. But the rise of tourism globally — growing at 3.9 percent and outpacing the global economy for the eighth consecutive year, according to a report this year by the World Travel & Tourism Council — has intensified efforts amid reports of overcrowding in popular destinations and risky behaviors for the sake of a selfie. Iceland inspired the central Oregon mountain town of Bend to create its tourism pledge in October 2017, a decision based in part on complaints by locals about a perceived shift in culture. The countywide population grew 16 percent, twice the state average, between 2010 and 2017. “Our geese honk, our cars don’t,” said Kevney Dugan, the president and chief executive of Visit Bend, where the pledge, directed at tourists as well as new residents, includes “I’ll be friendly and courteous, because that’s the Bend way.” “The economic development provided by tourism is important to our destination, so in no way is this meant to deter visitors,” Mr. Dugan said. “We all have things to learn when we go to a destination.” Since Bend’s 10-point pledge, a number of destinations across the United States have introduced them or plan to, often relying on humor to advance their messages on tourism websites. A draft of the forthcoming Visitors Pledge in Sedona says, “I won’t get killed for a killer photo.” The Aspen Pledge addresses responsible practices (“I will take awesome selfies, without endangering myself-ie”) and pokes fun, concluding with “I will not ski in jeans.” “Preaching to people will not get the message across,” said Debbie Braun, the president and chief executive of the Aspen Chamber Resort Association. The pledge can be found in restaurant bathroom stalls as well as in visitor centers. Introduced last November, New Zealand’s Tiaki Promise tries to convey local norms, like being prepared for abruptly changing weather conditions and winding mountain roads.  “There are cultural differences and understandings about how you behave in nature, so we needed to tell people what’s normal here,” said Rebecca Ingram, the general manager of New Zealand and government relations for Tourism New Zealand, explaining that national parks don’t have garbage collectors. “In some parts of the world, if you drop rubbish, you’re keeping someone employed. That doesn’t happen in New Zealand.” Where popular destinations have successfully marketed themselves to travelers, tourism pledges represent an attempt to manage their success. “You can see a locality setting a tone to signal to the market that this is what we care about and who we want to attract,” said Mark B. Milstein, the director of the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise at Cornell University. “It starts to raise awareness and get the tourist to think about how they impact the quality of a place and whether it will be there for future visitors.” The Bend Pledge has more than 30,000 signers and the Palau Pledge more than 226,000. But whether these have changed behaviors is hard to track. “It’s too new to know yet,” said Jonathan Tourtellot, chief executive of the Destination Stewardship Center, a nonprofit devoted to sustainable tourism, who believes the advent of overtourism will likely inspire more powerful pledges. “A lot of people don’t know it’s bad to leave the hiking trail. If a lot of people leave the trail it carves a new trail and causes erosion. This requires a level of thoughtfulness they may not have considered.” One group is advancing pledges from platitudes to fund-raising. Visit Bend, along with four other mountain towns recently launched Pledge for the Wild, a program that encourages visitors to donate to local nonprofits that care for the wild places they visit in those communities. It suggests travelers donate one dollar for each hour spent in the wild on a trip and ensures the money goes to local conservation groups and land managers maintaining them. “A pledge falls short of creating resources and revenue to tackle real problems, which could be maintaining trails,” Mr. Dugan said. “We celebrate wild places. The differentiator is, we give back.” 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

Schuetze,He spent almost eight days aboard a space station in 1978 and was hailed by East Germans as a symbol of socialist achievement.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/sigmund-jhn-dead.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"BERLIN — Sigmund Jähn, whose distinction as the first German to travel into space made him a Cold War symbol of socialist unity at a time when East and West Germany competed for national achievements, died on Saturday in Strausberg, Germany, outside Berlin. He was 82. The German Aerospace Center confirmed the death but did not specify a cause. On Aug. 26, 1978, Mr. Jähn and the Russian cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky left Earth aboard the Soyuz 31 and spent seven days, 20 hours and 49 minutes in space, most of it aboard the Salyut 6 space station. Their mission was to dock and resupply the Salyut 6 and run biological and medical experiments alongside the station’s long-duration crew, Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov. Mr. Jähn and Mr. Bykovsky returned to Earth on the Soyuz 29, the spacecraft the other crew had come up on. “Dear TV audience of the German Democratic Republic,” Mr. Jähn said in a radio transmission from the space station in 1978. “I’m very happy to be allowed to be the first German to take part in this manned spaceflight.” Mr. Jähn returned to a hero’s welcome and toured the country. Schools, ships and streets were named after him. Action figures of his likeness became popular. He was given medals and his image featured on postage stamps. In the Cold War propaganda battle, East Germany had beaten West Germany into space by five years; it wasn’t until 1983 that Ulf Merbold would accomplish the feat with NASA. “The first German in space, he always understood himself as a bridge builder between East and West in his advocacy for the peaceful use of space,” said Pascale Ehrenfreund, the head of the German Aerospace Center, where Mr. Jähn worked as an adviser after reunification. Even 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mr. Jähn retained his celebrity status. “In East Germany everyone knows Sigmund Jähn,” said Romy Mothes, the director of Deutsche Raumfahrtausstellung Morgenröthe-Rautenkranz, a space exploration museum in Mr. Jähn’s hometown. Sigmund Werner Paul Jähn was born on Feb. 13, 1937, in Morgenröthe-Rautenkranz, in the Vogtland district, a mountainous region in southeast Germany on the Czechoslovakian border. His father was a sawmill worker, his mother a homemaker. Mr. Jähn trained to be a printer before he joined the East German National People’s Army. He became a pilot and eventually flew the most advanced Soviet fighter jets. The first airplanes he ever saw as a boy were Allied bombers on their way to drop their payloads on Germany toward the end of World War II, he said in interviews. He rose through the ranks of the army’s air division, serving as political officer, trainer and crash inspector before being secretly admitted — after a series of grueling physical tests — for Russian cosmonaut training in 1976. Mr. Jähn attributed his success as a cosmonaut to his Russian- language skills and a strong stomach. “I didn’t get sick even once,” he told the newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last year. After his historic spaceflight, he was said to have been considered for a leadership position in the Communist Party, although in a 2018 interview he said that he was unsuitable for “loud speeches.” By the time Germany reunified in October 1990, Mr. Jähn had earned the rank of major general in the people’s army. After the army was dissolved upon reunification, he was unemployed briefly before signing up with the German Aerospace Center and later the European Space Agency as a consultant. He moved to Star City, the center of Russian cosmonaut training, outside Moscow, to instruct recruits. His survivors include his wife, Erika, and two daughters. Mr. Bykovsky died this year. On their mission together in 1978, Mr. Jähn had taken with him a toy figurine of Sandmännchen, a well-known character on an East German children’s television show, only to learn that Mr. Bykovsky had also brought a toy, of the Russian character Masha. “I was supposed to shoot footage for a children’s program while in orbit,” Mr. Jähn explained to Spiegel Online in a 2011 interview. “To that end, the Sandmännchen even wore his own spacesuit, specially made.” In an unplanned show of unity, the men filmed the characters having a pretend marriage celebration, but the footage could not be shown on East German television, Mr. Jähn said. Sandmännchen, it turned out, was supposed to remain single."
18,Weeknight Dinner Around the World,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:55:22 +0000","Sara Bonisteel, Kim Gougenheim and Lisa Dalsimer",We asked 18 families to show us what they have for dinner on a typical weeknight.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/dining/family-meals-around-the-world.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"Wasa Khuhaprema, center, prepares dinner for her family, including her parents, with help from her two young sons; the boys cook at least one night a week. This night, they ate an omelet with carrots, stir-fried minced pork and eggplant, and southern Thai sour curry with cauliflower. Family members are expected to clean up after themselves. The Osans — from left, Radha, Tara, Gurinder and Shikha — get dinner on the table at their home in Gurgaon, southwest of New Delhi, with help from a cook. The family eats around 9 p.m., and on this night, the meal consisted of palak paneer (spinach with cheese), raita, kadai aloo (potatoes with onions and spices), cucumber salad and roasted chapatis.  Claudia Bellucci, left, with her daughter, Fiamma, does most of the cooking for her family in Rome. For this meal, she picked herbs from her terrace for saltimbocca alla Romana (veal rolled with ham and sage). She also served homemade pesto with trofie pasta, a salad and baked tomatoes au gratin. From left, Basmah, Mazin, Abdulmalik and Abdulrahman Khojandi eat their meals — a mix of prepared and homemade foods — at home most nights during the week. Dinner on this evening was smashed beans, shakshuka and masoob, a mixture of banana, bread, dates, cream and honey. While many Haitian families eat their main meal at midday, the Charles family takes theirs in the evening, usually around 7 p.m. Youvelyne Rosier Charles, top left, prepares the meal: On this night, she made lalo with sos pwa nwa, a black bean sauce served with rice. Oranges and limes from the yard were used to marinate the meat and crab for the lalo. Ms. Charles’ 4-year-old daughter, Meghan, wearing barrettes, led the family in a short prayer. Typically the Levy family eats at around 7 p.m., but on the Sabbath, the meal begins around 8.

19,‘I’ve Been Dishonored’: French Chef Sues Michelin Guide Over Lost Star,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:25:19 +0000",Aurelien Breeden,"Marc Veyrat is disputing the downgrade of La Maison des Bois, his restaurant in the French Alps, which lost the guide’s maximum three-star rating.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/marc-veyrat-maison-des-bois-michelin-guide.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"PARIS — A celebrity chef has declared that he is suing France’s most revered culinary arbiter, the Michelin Guide, after its reviewers stripped his restaurant of its third star. The dispute between the chef, Marc Veyrat, and the guide started in January, when La Maison des Bois, Mr. Veyrat’s restaurant in the Haute-Savoie area of France, which borders Switzerland and Italy, was given a two-star rating, down from three stars the previous year. “I’ve been dishonored,” the chef told the broadcaster Franceinfo this week. “My team, I saw them cry.” Mr. Veyrat, 69, is now in open conflict with the Michelin Guide, arguing that it lacks transparency and casting doubt upon its reviewing methods. He has even suggested that the guide’s inspectors had never visited his restaurant. This summer, Mr. Veyrat — famous for his plant-based cuisine and for wearing a black shepherd’s hat — asked to be removed from the guide altogether. And on Monday, he said that he was suing the guide to “shed light on the exact reasons” for the downgrading, according to his lawyer. “If I made a mistake in my cuisine, I immediately take responsibility for it,” Mr. Veyrat told Franceinfo. “If you come tell me that this thing wasn’t right, I take responsibility, and then take away my star. But there is nothing to take responsibility for, because we know nothing, we don’t know what happened.” In an interview this summer with Le Point, Mr. Veyrat acknowledged that the downgrading had not affected his business — revenue was up 10 percent from last year, he said — and that his anger stemmed mostly from his wounded pride. “I feel like my parents have died a second time,” he told the magazine. “Can you imagine the shame I feel: I am the only chef in history to get a third star and then to lose it the next year.” Mr. Veyrat, through his lawyer, declined an interview request for this article. The decisions of the red-covered Michelin Guide are closely watched in France. Every year, the 20 to 30 restaurants that get its top accolade, a three-star rating, are scrutinized to see which chefs are on the rise and which are losing their shine. This year, 27 restaurants were awarded three stars, and 84 were awarded two. Michelin stars bring prestige but also intense pressure to chefs, some of whom have committed suicide. In recent years, some chefs have even asked for their stars to be removed, citing the psychological or financial burden of maintaining their rating. Mr. Veyrat, however, felt very strongly about keeping his. He called the guide’s decision to strip it away “a serious affront.” Mr. Veyrat — who hails from the Savoie region in the French Alps, which is famous for fragrant cheeses like Reblochon or Beaufort — felt particularly insulted that, in his telling, a Michelin inspector who ordered a soufflé had mistaken a saffron-infused emulsion for Cheddar, “because it was yellow.” “And you call that knowing the terroir!” he said. “That’s just crazy.” The Michelin Guide said in a statement on Monday that Mr. Veyrat’s accusations were baseless. “We understand Mr. Veyrat’s disappointment, and no one is disputing his talent, although we regret his unreasonable persistence in accusing and noisily communicating,” the Michelin Guide said, adding that its “first duty” was to “inform the consumers.” “We will carefully study his demands and respond calmly,” the group said. The 2019 edition of the guide gives no clear hint of what prompted the downgrade at La Maison des Bois, which has stunning views of the surrounding mountains and pine forests. The review praises Mr. Veyrat for being “true to his reputation” and calls his cuisine a “pastoral symphony” that mixes “woodland fragrances and Alpine herbs.” Emmanuel Ravanas, a lawyer for Mr. Veyrat, said on Tuesday that the immediate goal of the civil suit was to compel the guide to produce documents, like restaurant bills and reviewer notes, that would help explain the demotion. “If the restaurant was downgraded from three to two stars because the reviewers thought they were eating Cheddar when there wasn’t any, then that is extremely serious,” Mr. Ravanas said by telephone. “We don’t know on what criteria he was evaluated, with what appear to be very big methodological errors that the Michelin is refusing to communicate about.” Gwendal Poullennec, the international head of the Michelin Guides, said this year in an interview with Le Monde that officials from the guide had met with Mr. Veyrat to explain the decision to downgrade the restaurant. But Mr. Poullennec added that the guide could not take the chef out of it. (He also denied the Cheddar-related accusations.) “The stars from the Michelin guide do not belong to the chefs, it is not up to them to give them up,” Mr. Poullennec said, adding that the guide’s reviewers were highly qualified professionals and that Mr. Veyrat had questioned their methods only after he lost his third star, not when he was awarded three the previous year. “Accepting a promotion and rejecting a demotion, I’m sorry, but that’s bad faith,” he said. Mr. Ravanas, Mr. Veyrat’s lawyer, said a court hearing had been set for Nov. 27. If Mr. Veyrat’s legal team is able to obtain documentation that proves a mistake, they will ask the court to force the Michelin Guide to remove its entry for La Maison des Bois, Mr. Ravanas said."
20,How the U.K. Supreme Court’s Rebuke to Boris Johnson Remakes British Law,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 23:06:56 +0000",Mark Landler and Benjamin Mueller,"In ruling a suspension of Parliament “unlawful,” some scholars argue that the court brought an American style of judicial review to Britain, with all that entails.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/uk-constitution-supreme-court-boris-johnson.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — Britain’s all-consuming debate over Brexit has dragged another of its respected institutions into uncharted territory, as the Supreme Court struck down Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s suspension of Parliament, an extraordinary intervention by the judiciary into a political dispute. The unanimous decision, handed down on Tuesday, is an unalloyed defeat for Mr. Johnson and will propel Britain into a fresh round of political turmoil. But it is even more significant for what it says about the role of the country’s highest court, which has historically steered clear of politics. By ruling that Mr. Johnson acted unlawfully — and doing so in such stark language — the court asserted its right to curb a government that obstructed Parliament’s ability to “carry out its constitutional functions as a legislature and as the body responsible for the supervision of the executive.” But critics warned that in taking upon itself the right to adjudicate disputes between the government and Parliament, the court would soon find itself thrust into the same charged, highly partisan waters that have politicized decisions of the United States Supreme Court in recent decades. The sweeping nature of the ruling surprised legal scholars, even those who had predicted that the court would find some way to rebuke Mr. Johnson for his widely protested decision to suspend, or prorogue, the Parliament earlier this month. “It’s absolutely stunning,” said James Grant, a senior lecturer in law at King’s College London. “It’s stronger than a lot of us expected. It has developed long-established common law principles in a new direction.” Dr. Grant said the ruling reaffirmed Parliament’s right to hold the government to account in the face of a prime minister determined to pull Britain out of the European Union next month, regardless of the views of lawmakers. Other scholars, however, expressed regret that the court had felt compelled by Mr. Johnson’s actions to cast off a long tradition of legal restraint. Brexit has pushed the court, as it has Parliament itself, into wholly new terrain, where old rules and traditions no longer seem to apply. “It is a great pity that it should have been necessary for the court to intervene,” said Jonathan Sumption, who served as a Supreme Court justice from 2012 to 2018. “But if the government takes an ax to the political convention and there are no rules, then there is a complete void in which the executive can act however it likes.” At issue was whether Mr. Johnson, in suspending Parliament for five weeks in the middle of a dispute over Britain’s departure from the European Union, had stymied the ability of lawmakers to have a say in that process. The court, in upholding a previous ruling by a Scottish high court, judged that he had. Not only did the court declare the prime minister’s action unlawful, it also declared the order itself, which Queen Elizabeth II issued at Mr. Johnson’s request, “unlawful, void, and of no effect.” The request, said the court’s president, Baroness Brenda Hale, might as well have been a “blank sheet of paper.” Stephen Tierney, a professor of constitutional theory at Edinburgh University, said it was “astonishing” that the court had ruled decisively that it “can review something as fundamental as that, done by Her Majesty, as unlawful.” “The court is getting involved in what was largely seen as the internal workings of Parliament and its supreme power,” Professor Tierney said. “That in itself is unprecedented in the U.K. system. It’s far more similar to the sort of judicial review you’d get in a country with a codified constitution. But to arrive at its conclusion the court has had to pluck unwritten constitutional principles from what they take to be political practice.” In the United States, the courts have intervened regularly to challenge actions of the Trump administration, such as its ban on visitors from predominantly Muslim countries. The Supreme Court routinely exercises judicial review by actively interpreting the American Constitution. Britain, however, relies on a partly unwritten set of traditions and conventions that have treated a sovereign Parliament as the supreme power in the land. Once the courts venture into the political sphere and begin to pass judgment on Parliament’s actions, some legal analysts say, there is no going back. The momentous nature of the decision was evident in the live television coverage of the hearing Tuesday morning. Lady Hale and 10 fellow justices took their seats behind a polished semicircular table (Britain’s high court, unlike its American counterpart, allows cameras in the courtroom). Clad in black and wearing a large bejeweled brooch in the shape of a spider, Lady Hale read the ruling aloud in a quiet, firm voice. She emphasized that the decision, which came after three days of legal submissions, had been unanimous. The justices, she said, had weighed the court’s role in judging the prerogative powers of the government, in cases dating back to 1611. There was no doubt, Lady Hale said, that the court had jurisdiction, since the case involved an action that prevented Parliament from fulfilling its constitutional duty. Lawyers for the government had argued that the courts had no jurisdiction, an argument that an English lower court had accepted. “The conduct of government by a prime minister and cabinet, collectively responsible and accountable to Parliament, lies at the heart of Westminster democracy,” Lady Hale declared. She dismissed the government’s legal case for suspending Parliament, which had been laid out by Mr. Johnson’s legislative director, Nikki da Costa. And she used withering language to describe the effect of the court’s ruling on the formal order to prorogue. It would now be as if officials had “walked in with a blank sheet of paper,” Lady Hale said. She said it was up to the speaker of the House of Commons to decide when it would reconvene. The speaker, John Bercow, said the house would come back into session Wednesday morning, three weeks before the date the government had set. Legal scholars said the most striking passage of the ruling was the court’s decision to effectively cement a new constitutional principle: parliamentary accountability, or the right of lawmakers to scrutinize the workings of government in what had previously been legally uncodified ways. While legal experts said the decision had the potential to set a precedent for further judicial activism, they noted that it came in exceptional circumstances: a government that appeared ready to flout any and all rules that threatened its plans to take Britain out of the European Union by the deadline of Oct. 31. “We’ll hear a lot people alleging that this is a power grab from the Supreme Court,” Dr. Grant said. “It’s really not. This is not about the Supreme Court diminishing the power of elected politicians. It’s about ensuring that the elected politicians are able to fulfill their constitutional functions.” Lord Sumption, the former Supreme Court justice, said that while he wished the court had not felt obliged to act, the effect of the decision was “to reinstate the democratic legitimacy of public decision-making.” Prorogation, he added, was a procedural issue rather than a substantive government policy. For some legal experts, the decision underscored the need for Britain to confront the costs of its uncodified constitution. “This is constitutionality on the fly,” said Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer at Doughty Street Chambers. Although the ruling could be seen as a validation of Britain’s flexible constitutional system, Mr. Wagner said, it also highlighted the legal morass that encompasses so many basic decisions of the prime minister. The ruling, he said, entrenched an emerging principle that the prime minister is accountable to Parliament. But in so doing, it is likely to anger segments of British society for whom the Supreme Court, an institution founded only in 2009, has been largely anonymous until today. Where the courts view themselves as defending existing constitutional principles, critics have accused them as making things up. “The courts see it as revealing the Constitution, but many people will see it as inventing the Constitution,” Mr. Wagner said. “That’s the tension.”"
21,"Trump and Johnson, Together on World Stage, Eye Troubles Back Home","Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:25:17 +0000",Peter Baker,"President Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, leaders who share an affinity and style of politics, are attending the United Nations General Assembly with domestic troubles at home.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/trump-johnson-un.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"If nothing else, they have each other. On one of the most difficult days in both of their tenures, President Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, stars of an emerging trans-Atlantic buddy story, met in New York to talk global affairs only to have to fend off troubles back home. For Mr. Johnson, it was a devastating unanimous ruling by Britain’s Supreme Court that he violated the law by suspending Parliament amid the roiling debate over how to leave the European Union. Sitting with Mr. Trump at the United Nations on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson was asked by a reporter whether he would resign. “Let’s be absolutely clear — we respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court,” Mr. Johnson said. “I disagree profoundly with what they had to say,” he added, but he said he would proceed with plans for withdrawing from the European Union by the end of October. “Frankly, I think we need to get on with Brexit,” he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy. “That was a very nasty question,” he said, noting that it came from an American reporter. Mr. Johnson was understanding. “I think he was asking a question, to be fair, that a lot of British reporters would have asked.” Mr. Trump minimized the significance of the court ruling for Mr. Johnson. “For him it’s another day in the office,” the president said. “Tomorrow’s another day in Parliament,” Mr. Johnson interjected with a laugh. Mr. Trump assured him he would have better luck in the courts in the future. “We were 0 for 7 with the Supreme Court,” he recalled. “Since then, we’ve almost run the table. We’ve won a lot of decisions. I’m sure that’s going to happen to you.” Mr. Johnson will also be returning to Parliament with a new scandal hanging over him. The Sunday Times of London reported this week that, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, his office had directed tens of thousands of pounds in government money to a young entrepreneur who was a close friend. As for Mr. Trump, he sought to deflect the growing furor over his effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his leading Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., at the same time he held up $391 million in American aid to the former Soviet republic. Mr. Trump said he had held up the aid not as leverage but because he hates giving money away and thinks European nations should step up to do so more. “I keep asking the same question: Why is the United States that’s always paying these foreign countries?” he said. Mr. Trump has acknowledged raising questions about Mr. Biden and accusations of corruption with Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a July 25 telephone call. But “there was never any quid pro quo,” he said on Tuesday. “With us there was no pressure applied.” Earlier in the day, he dismissed the Democratic calls for impeachment as a new “witch hunt” that was part of an election strategy. “I’m leading in the polls and they have no idea how to stop me,” he told reporters, although in most polls he trails the leading Democratic candidates. “The only way they can try is through impeachment.” The camaraderie between the president and the prime minister was on display throughout their remarks together. The two talked again about striking a trade deal after Britain leaves the European Union. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Johnson, who has lost repeated votes in Parliament and suffered a revolt in his own Conservative Party, is doing “a fantastic job” and would manage to find a resolution to the Brexit debate. “He’s a friend of mine,” Mr. Trump said. “It takes a man like this to get it done and they have to get it done.”"
22,"Earthquake Strikes Pakistan, Killing at Least 22","Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:01:44 +0000",Salman Masood,A 5.6 magnitude earthquake rocked several cities in Pakistan and some parts of the Kashmir region under its control.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/asia/pakistan-earthquake.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LAHORE, Pakistan — A 5.6 magnitude earthquake rocked several cities in northern Pakistan and parts of the Kashmir region under its control, leaving at least 22 people dead and more than 700 wounded, officials said Tuesday. The strong tremors, which struck just after 4 p.m. on Tuesday and lasted for several seconds, shook buildings and houses, causing panicked people to pour out into roads and streets. In Lahore, Pakistan’s second-largest city, people scrambled out of buildings, many praying out loud. “Our focus will be on the rescue operation in the next couple of days,” Lt. Gen. Muhammad Afzal, the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority, said during a news conference in Islamabad, the capital. “After that we will start the relief and repatriation efforts.” The earthquake brought back painful memories of the magnitude 7.6 earthquake that struck the same region in October 2005 and left more than 75,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. On Tuesday, several houses were damaged and one building collapsed in Mirpur, part of the Pakistani-controlled area of Kashmir, government officials said. As the injured streamed into hospitals, officials declared an emergency in Mirpur, rescue officials said. Television news networks broadcast images of a road that buckled in several places, leaving several vehicles stuck in the depressions. Videos shared by social media users showed images of people running out of houses and building during the tremors. One widely circulated video from Mirpur showed several men running out of a house before its roof caved in. Most of the damage was reported there and in Kotli, another part of Kashmir. Army troops have been mobilized to help civilian authorities in Kashmir, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman of the Pakistan Army, said. Raja Farooq Haider Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, cut short a visit to Lahore and headed back to his native region soon after the news of the damage surfaced. While Pakistan’s meteorological department reported that the earthquake was magnitude 5.8, the United States Geological Survey revised its initial figure, stating that the earthquake measured 5.6. Officials said that the Mangla Dam, which holds one of Pakistan’s biggest water reservoirs, and its power-generation house were safe, although operations were temporarily shut down as a safety measure. After hearing initial estimates of the damages, it appeared, officials felt that local authorities could cope with the emergency situation. “For now, things are under control,” Lt. Gen. Afzal, the head of the national disaster management authority, said."
23,"Lady Hale, U.K. Supreme Court Judge, Speaks Calmly and Brings Down the Hammer","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 09:59:59 +0000",Yonette Joseph and Ceylan Yeginsu,"The judge has carved out a long, trailblazing career as an academic, legal reformer and feminist — and she loves striking brooches.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/lady-hale-supreme-court-uk.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — When the full weight of Britain’s Supreme Court came down on Tuesday against the suspension of Parliament, it was dropped like a hammer on Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the first woman to serve as the court’s president: Lady Hale. In calm, clipped, riveting tones, she read the damning judgment from a sheaf of papers ruling on the act of suspension, called “prorogation.” “The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification,” the judge said. She added: “The prorogation was void and of no effect — Parliament has not been prorogued.” There were gasps in the court and tears from the lawyers who had argued the case, according to the BBC. Superlatives erupted on television and social media, as visibly stunned journalists delivered the news: “Unprecedented.” “Extraordinary.” “Gobsmacked.” “Speechless.” “No one expected this.” Minutes later, “Lady Hale” became a trending term on Twitter. Who is Lady Hale? The appointment in 2017 of Brenda Hale as president of the Supreme Court was a landmark decision: She was the first woman to hold the position, just as she had been the first woman appointed to Britain’s highest court. An academic, legal reformer and feminist, the judge took the office at 72 after being described as “one of the most forthright and liberalizing influences on the court.” Among Lady Hale’s most high-profile previous cases was ruling on whether the government had the power by itself to invoke Article 50 of the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty, the formal start of the Brexit process. She sided with the majority in deciding that Britain’s departure from the European Union had to be authorized by Parliament. She has also backed the use of random stop-and-search powers for the police to tackle crime and gang violence, saying that the tactic brought “great benefits to the public” and that there were sufficient safeguards around its use, even though some black Britons have denounced it as discriminatory. Lady Hale said: “Put bluntly, it is mostly young black lives that will be saved if there is less gang violence in London and some other cities. It is the randomness and, therefore, the unpredictability of the search which has the deterrent effect and also increases the chances that weapons will be detected.” Born in Yorkshire, England, to two teachers, both of whom became school principals, she attended Girton College at Cambridge University, where as a law student she graduated at the top of her class in 1966, “one of six women in a year of well over a hundred men,” according to British Vogue. She told the magazine of her time at Cambridge: “I did some singing, I was a member of the Gilbert & Sullivan Society, which was really good fun. I did a bit of acting … Yes, I had an active social life.” She later taught law at Manchester University and became a professor before qualifying as a barrister. In the 1980s, she was appointed to the Law Commission, an independent body that scrutinizes laws in England and Wales, and became a Queen’s Counsel, a member of a select group of senior trial lawyers. On the commission, she had a hand in overhauling laws relating to children, domestic violence and mental health. Among her decisions that paved the way to landmark changes was a ruling that domestic violence was not limited to physical contact. Her work helped create major pieces of legislation, including the Children Act 1989, the Family Law Act 1996 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005. In 2004, Brenda Hale became a baroness and Britain’s first female law lord, as the country’s most senior judges were then known. On her appointment, she chose a coat of arms with the Latin motto “Omnia Feminae Aequissimae”: “Women are equal to everything.” In 2018, she appeared on an episode of the British reality TV show “MasterChef” — the theme was female suffrage — and she is one of the most visible members of the 12-member Supreme Court, including on the court’s Instagram page. In the September article in British Vogue, she was called “a heroine for our times.” Known as an advocate of diversity, she said this year during a speech to commemorate the centenary of women’s entry into the legal profession that more of Britain’s judiciary should be women. Just 29 percent of court judges in the country are women, according to the Ministry of Justice. “We should be half of judges at least,” Lady Hale said. She has denied, however, claims that she is a “judicial activist.” She has also been vocal about the wigs that many advocates are required to wear in court. “I have this specific objection that everyone has to wear these men’s wigs,” she said in an interview with Prospect Magazine. “I had a fantasy once that on my last day of having to wear a wig in court I would go and hire a madame de pompadour women’s wig and powder that up.” More recently, she criticized the fact that when she had been the only woman on the Supreme Court, all her fellow judges there belonged to an all-male private member’s club. She said she found it unacceptable for them to have a professional space to socialize and interact that excluded her and other women. “She’s already visible as one of the very few female judges in this country but has embraced her role as a woman with a different perspective,” Afua Hirsch, a former trial lawyer and author of a children’s book about Lady Hale, said of her in an interview with the BBC. Currently, Lady Hale, Lady Black and Lady Arden are the only female judges on the Supreme Court bench. Lady Hale’s signature sartorial touch runs to jeweled pins and brooches. Internet users zeroed in on the spider attached to her chest on Tuesday as she read the decision tearing down Mr. Johnson’s prorogation decision. “Lady Hale demonstrating the potential for vast novelistic sub-narratives offered by a correctly chosen brooch. What a tangled web we weave, indeed,” one Twitter user wrote. It reminded observers of how former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright used pins and brooches as a diplomatic tool. For Ms. Albright, it started when she was the ambassador at the United Nations and Saddam Hussein called her a serpent. After that, she wore a snake pin every time she had to deal with matters related to Iraq. “On good days, I wore flowers and butterflies and balloons, and on bad days, all kinds of bugs and carnivorous animals,” Ms. Albright told Smithsonian.com in 2010. “I saw it as an additional way of expressing what I was saying, a visual way to deliver a message.” People started creating T-shirts with the spider’s image to raise money for a homeless charity. More generally, Britons, opposition lawmakers and others expressed antipathy toward Mr. Johnson — calling for him to resign — by praising the face of the court who brought him the bad news. One person wrote on Twitter: “Lady Hale QC, brilliant UK Supreme Court President, assuming the institutional duty to preserve the essential constitutional functions of the Parliament, and implicitly rejecting superior powers of the executive. This is how democracy prevails.” Speaker John Bercow told reporters that members of Parliament would return and get back to work on Wednesday morning. Mr. Johnson, however, sounded a note of defiance, telling reporters in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly, “I strongly disagree with what the justices have found.” Pro-Brexit lawmakers also expressed disquiet about the court’s decision. Mr. Johnson said there was a strong case for getting on with the queen’s speech and with Brexit on Oct. 31. Reporters rushed to point out the obvious: Since a queen’s speech can’t occur until Parliament is prorogued, and the court had unanimously invalidated his plan, the prime minister is once again boxed in."
24,A Slain Jewish Girl’s Diary of Life Under the Soviets and the Nazis,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 03:50:11 +0000",Joanna Berendt,"Described as a counterpart to Anne Frank’s diary, a journal written by Renia Spiegel, a Jewish girl who lived in Poland during World War II, is being published in English.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/holocaust-diary-renia-spiegel.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"PRZEMYSL, Poland — She was a Jewish teenager in a small trade city in southeastern Poland when she began writing her diary, months before the advent of World War II. By the time she was shot in the head by Nazi soldiers, she had chronicled life under two totalitarian regimes: the Soviets who advanced from the east and the Nazis who came from the west.  Her journal, hidden in a safe deposit box in New York City for decades, has been described as a counterpart to Anne Frank’s diary, a valuable historical document and a poignant coming-of-age story.  Now, the journal of the teenager, Renia Spiegel, all 700 perfectly preserved pages, is to be published in English for the first time. Released on Thursday,  it was to arrive in bookstores in 13 countries on Sept. 24, including Britain, Germany, Russia and the United States.  At a moment when basic agreement over simple truths has become a political battleground and history a weapon, the publication of the book, “Renia’s Diary,” offers a reminder of the power of bearing witness. In the first entry, Renia made clear why she was writing: It is Jan. 31, 1939. She does not know that in seven months, war would come to the increasingly ruined town of Przemysl, a place of noisy school grounds, intimate cafes and romantic alleys where first kisses were stolen. By July 30, 1942, less than two months after she turned 18, she would be dead.  The last passage in the diary was written by the man she had loved during those terrible years, Zygmunt Schwarzer, who survived Auschwitz and was supposed to look after the diary after Renia and his parents went into hiding to avoid being deported to concentration camps. The Nazis found their hide-out, in the attic of a house in Przemysl, and dragged them into the street. After they were shot, he wrote:  Alexandra Garbarini, a professor and historian at Williams College in Massachusetts who specializes in Holocaust diaries, said that Renia’s story was unique because she experienced both Soviet and Nazi rule, providing rare insight into Stalin’s less-examined occupation. “This is such a complete text,” Professor Garbarini said. “It shows the life of a teenager before the war, after the war breaks, until she has to move to the ghetto and is executed. It’s absolutely remarkable.”  It is not clear what Mr. Schwarzer did with the journal before he was sent to Auschwitz, or how he retrieved it in the 1950s, when he was living in New York. His son, Mitchell Schwarzer, said he did not remember if his father ever told him who had given him the journal. “I just remember him telling me one day: ‘Look, this is my first girl’s journal! We were incredibly close. She was my spiritual soul mate,’” he said by phone. Mr. Schwarzer said his father had become obsessed with the diary. “He made copies of it and read it for hours,” he said. “God knows what my mother made of this.” The journal is first and foremost an intimate testimony of the challenges of becoming a woman and falling in love during a time of war. Renia, in many ways, represents tens of thousands of young women who lived during that time and whose lives were cut short before they could fully embrace their youth and first loves. She was 15 and staying with her younger sister, Elizabeth, a child actress known as the “Polish Shirley Temple,” at her grandparents’ home in Przemysl when the war broke out. Renia’s love for Zygmunt, whom she calls “Zygu” and who was one year her senior, is the main topic of her journal, and her writing reveals a typical teenager with adolescent self-consciousness. Months of painfully shy romantic advances by Zygmunt and skittish expressions of affection by Renia preceded their first kiss, after a walk on the evening of June 20, 1941:  This was just two days before the Third Reich declared war on the Soviet Union, ending the nonaggression pact, with the Germans sweeping into eastern Poland. For Renia, when war and ordinary life intertwined, love was  almost a necessity, providing desperately needed comfort. She wrote a few weeks after her first kiss: After Renia and Zygmunt’s parents went into hiding — they did not receive the work permit stamps they needed to avoid deportation — he took over the journal. For the next couple of days, he reported on his desperate, unsuccessful efforts to save “these three most precious human beings in my life.” He later made his way to New York, where Renia’s mother, Roza, and younger sister, Elizabeth Bellak, born as Ariana Spiegel, were also living. Mr. Schwarzer eventually passed the diary to them. Ms. Bellak, now 88, said that she stashed it for decades in a safe deposit box because she could not bear to read it. “Renia was like a mother to me when our own beloved mother was far away,” she said. “Every time I opened her diary, I started crying. It was too emotional.” Renia was an aspiring poet, and her journal features mature political manifestoes and captivating love poems for which, Ms. Bellak said, she had won numerous awards before the war. On June 7, 1942, she wrote: It was Ms. Bellak’s daughter, Alexandra Renata Bellak, who recognized the journal’s value. In 2014, she reached out to the Polish film director Tomasz Magierski and asked him to help them find a publisher. Not only did Mr. Magierski help them do so, he also made a documentary, “Broken Dreams,” based on the journal. It opened in a Polish cinema on Sept. 18. Marcel Tuchman, who was friends with Renia and Zygmunt in Przemysl during the war, recalled the bond the two shared. “They were just two young people who, thanks to their deep love for one another, saved themselves from the horrors of the war,” he said in an interview in 2016. Mr. Tuchman remained close to Mr. Schwarzer after they were both sent to Auschwitz, survived it and immigrated to the United States, where they became doctors. Mr. Schwarzer died in 1992, at age 69, and Mr. Tuchman in 2018, at age 97. But in 1989, during a meeting with Ms. Bellak in New York, he reunited with the diary one last time and wrote:  Ms. Bellak wrote in the afterword of the diary that Mr. Schwarzer had taught her that the “past isn’t long gone; it’s present in our hearts, our actions and the lessons we teach our children.” “Zygmunt was happily married to Gienia, another Jewish girl from Poland,” Ms. Bellak added. “But he never forgot my sister.”"
25,Passengers Return to Britain After Thomas Cook Collapse,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 03:56:57 +0000",Megan Specia and Iliana Magra,"As a repatriation effort began, the head of Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority said “nobody is stranded.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/thomas-cook-collapse.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — One day after the British tour operator and airline Thomas Cook abruptly collapsed, leaving hundreds of thousands of travelers scrambling to make arrangements, the head of the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain promised that “nobody” from her country would be stranded and that subsidiaries in several countries were working to bring people home. Thomas Cook said on Friday that about 600,000 people were traveling abroad on its services, raising the prospect of hundreds of thousands of travelers stranded overseas after the company collapsed in spectacular fashion, but initial reports suggested that governments and private companies were moving to bring people home. In addition to the vast repatriation effort in Britain, several companies that were either subsidiaries of Thomas Cook or that use the name while running independently were still operating in China, France, Germany and India. But shortly after midday on Tuesday, Thomas Cook’s subsidiary in the Netherlands, which on Monday said it was open for business as usual, reversed course and said it had filed for insolvency. The Thomas Cook subsidiary in Belgium said on Tuesday that it remained operational, for now, but added that it was declaring partial bankruptcy and had laid off 75 employees. Spain’s acting minister for tourism, Reyes Maroto, told reporters on Tuesday that there was still time to save Thomas Cook’s subsidiaries in Germany and Scandinavia from bankruptcy, and that her government was having conversations “on the highest level” with officials in Germany and Sweden about the issue. The aim, Ms. Maroto said, was to have those markets secured for Spanish tourism, at least for the winter season. The developments at Thomas Cook have raised questions about whether more could have been done to prevent the company’s sudden collapse and whether the actions of its leadership may have contributed to the failure. The British business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, in a letter to the head of the Insolvency Service, the body appointed to handle Thomas Cook’s remaining assets, asked for an examination to be opened into the role of the company’s directors in the insolvency, requesting that the matter be given priority status. The Financial Reporting Council, the British accounting regulator, said that it had also been asked by Ms. Leadsom to look into the failure of the company and determine whether to open an investigation. The repatriation of British travelers was being described as the largest such peacetime effort in the country’s history, and Deidre Hutton, the chairwoman of the Civil Aviation Authority, speaking to the BBC on Tuesday morning, said that around 15,000 people had already been flown back to Britain. “Nobody is stranded, everybody will get their holiday and they will be brought back at the time they would have come back anyway,” she said. “I’m conscious that we’ve got a huge job to do still, because that’s about 8 percent of the total, but a reasonable start.” Aena, the largest airport operator in Spain, said on Tuesday that 18 repatriation flights were scheduled to depart from its properties, and all were operating normally. “So far, the affected airports have registered no complaints,” Aena said in Twitter post at midday. An additional 74 flights were scheduled to bring back another 16,500 people back to Britain on Tuesday, and over the next two weeks, an additional 135,000 passengers will be repatriated, with the effort continuing until Oct. 6. Passengers who are traveling after that date will have to make their own arrangements. Around 60 percent of the cost for the flights was funded by a government insurance program called the Air Travel Organizer’s License, which means that Thomas Cook customers who booked package travel — generally, some combination of flights, hotels and car rental — are assured of refunds for future canceled trips and for repatriation free of charge. Customers who bought only flights from Thomas Cook do not have the same protections and may need to rely more on personal travel insurance, if they have it. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said the government should look into how such situations could be avoided in the future, and seemed to back rules that would turn over responsibility for repatriation to travel companies rather than the government. “How can we make sure that tour operators take proper precautions with their business models where you don’t end up with a situation where the taxpayer, the state, is having to step in and bring people home?” Mr. Johnson said, according to Reuters. He voiced his criticism of the company from New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly this week. Speaking at a climate summit on Monday, he asked how business leaders managed to pay themselves large sums as the company went “down the tubes.” He later tweeted on Monday night that he had met with British Consulate employees in New York who were working to repatriate travelers and thanked the consular workers for their efforts. “It’s a tough time for those who have had holidays disrupted but team hard at work to support them,” he wrote. In the bustling London Gatwick Airport on Tuesday, there were few signs of the company’s collapse a day earlier. Christian Brisland, 46, was one of the thousand repatriated to Britain and said that other than a short delay in his new flight from the Greek island of Kefalonia, his return went smoothly. “We contacted the Civil Aviation Authority, registered with them, and they booked us on an EasyJet flight,” he said as he left the airport, wearing a straw hat and a pair of shorts despite the rain. “It was really easy.” Shelly Louis, 49, who also returned to London from Kefalonia on Tuesday, said the company’s collapse had not worried her, as the worst-case scenario would have meant extending her vacation. “There is no point in worrying about something you cannot control,” she said. But travelers who had booked vacation packages through Thomas Cook were scrambling to find alternative ways to get to their intended destinations. Many customers turned to social media to denounce price increases for some popular destinations, accusing competitors of cashing in on Thomas Cook’s failure. “It is the market in action,” Andrew Charlton, managing director of the consulting firm Aviation Advocacy, said in a phone interview. He said that “a major player has fallen out of the market and reduced capacity” and that the Civil Aviation Authority had booked any available spots for the next two weeks. Thomas Cook had struggled financially for some time and announced its closing after negotiations to obtain at least 200 million pounds, or $250 million, in additional emergency financing failed over the weekend. The British government decided not to bail out Thomas Cook, on the grounds that it would set a dangerous precedent for other companies, but Condor, an airline that is a Thomas Cook affiliate in Germany, may find itself in a more favorable position. When the German carrier Air Berlin came close to bankruptcy in 2017, the government granted the airline a bridging loan of 150 million euros, about $165 million, that allowed it to continue flying. Condor is hoping for the same treatment, and Peter Altmaier, the economics minister, said on Tuesday that the government would decide whether to issue a loan in the coming days. Thomas Cook India posted a statement on its website on Tuesday reassuring customers that it was not part of the British company after being acquired in 2012. The Dutch Thomas Cook subsidiary said it had not yet declared bankruptcy and so was open for business as usual. A Chinese subsidiary of Thomas Cook, which caters largely to Chinese tourists traveling abroad, said on Monday that its operations would not be affected by the bankruptcy of the parent company."
26,Spanish Court Approves Franco’s Exhumation,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:26:52 +0000",Raphael Minder,The ruling follows a yearlong judicial battle between the caretaker Socialist government and the dictator’s family.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/spain-franco-exhume.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"MADRID — The Supreme Court in Spain on Tuesday approved the government’s plan to exhume Francisco Franco, the former dictator, in a case that revived the debate over his legacy, 80 years after he won the country’s civil war and started building the underground basilica in which he was later buried. The decision follows a yearlong judicial battle between the caretaker Socialist government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and the family of Franco, who sought to block the exhumation. Mr. Sánchez, writing on Twitter, called the ruling “a great victory of Spanish democracy,” saying that the exhumation plan had been driven by “the determination to compensate for the suffering of the victims” of Franco. Franco’s relatives said on Tuesday that they would appeal to the Spanish Constitutional Court, but they will first have to demonstrate that the Supreme Court ruling breached fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The judges approved the exhumation unanimously, according to a spokeswoman for the court. Their decision was made behind closed doors, and a full verdict is expected to be published in the coming days. Franco’s family promised on Tuesday to pursue its legal battle “to the very end,” but Mr. Sánchez’s administration responded that it would go ahead with the exhumation “very quickly,” which presumably means before Nov. 10, when Spain is to hold a repeat national election. The election — the fourth in four years — was called this month, after Mr. Sánchez failed to garner sufficient support from smaller parties to get voted into office by Parliament. Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the left-wing party Unidas Podemos, said that exhuming Franco represented “a very important step toward repairing the shame that we have carried during 40 years of democracy.” But Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, an ultranationalist party that got its first seats in Parliament in April, said on Twitter that Mr. Sánchez was starting his election campaign by “profanating graves” and “unearthing hatreds.” As part of a last-ditch attempt to stop the exhumation, Franco’s family has appealed separately to a local court in Madrid that grants public works licenses, arguing that there are technical and safety concerns linked to the opening Franco’s tomb, which is behind the basilica’s altar. Upon taking office in June 2018, Mr. Sánchez announced that Franco’s exhumation would happen “immediately.” Instead, his plan got entangled in a political and legal quagmire, which also revived the debate over the law of amnesty for past crimes that was adopted in 1977, two years after Franco’s death, as part of Spain’s return to democracy. Franco’s relatives appealed to the Supreme Court, which suspended the exhumation plan in June to give it time to review the case. While the government has suggested that Franco should be moved to his family crypt in the cemetery of El Pardo, on the outskirts of Madrid, Franco’s family has argued that the only alternative resting place for the former dictator would be inside the crypt of Madrid’s cathedral — a suggestion that the government vowed to block. Mr. Sánchez wants to exhume Franco as part of a broader effort to revive a law of historical memory that was approved in 2007, under a previous Socialist government, but was shelved and deprived of state funding by the conservative government led by Mariano Rajoy. One of the main goals of the law was to support and help finance the opening of the more than 2,000 mass graves that dot Spain and to identify the remains of those inside, who mostly died during the three years of the civil war of the 1930s. Conservative politicians have denounced Mr. Sánchez’s determination to exhume Franco as a political strategy to strengthen ideological divisions, but it has led to concerns that it could also bolster the far right, as seen in the emergence of Vox. Mr. Sánchez and his Socialists won the election in April, but fell short of an outright majority of Parliament seats. Mr. Sánchez will be hoping that voters give the Socialists a stronger mandate to govern in the do-over election, and he has been bolstered by the splintering of some smaller left-wing parties. But there is no guarantee that the new vote will yield a different result, and opinion polls suggest that turnout will be low. The disillusionment comes in part because of voters’ exasperation with a generation of party leaders who have plunged Spain into another round of political limbo, similar to that of 2016, when Spain spent 10 months under a caretaker conservative government. Ignacio del Valle, a novelist whose books are often set during Franco’s rule, said that, while it made sense to remove Franco from a burial site that was built as “a pantheon for a dictator,” he was against the politics surrounding Mr. Sánchez’s plan. “We don’t need to exhume a corpse now to cover up for the incapacity of the politicians of this generation,” he said. Even if Franco were to be exhumed before the election, Spanish politicians have already engaged in a dispute about what to do with the dictator’s current burial site, known as the Valley of the Fallen, which is also one of Europe’s largest mass graves. At least 33,000 were buried there after the civil war, including some Republican prisoners whom Franco used as his labor force to build the mausoleum and its underground basilica. José Guirao, the Spanish culture minister, has suggested that the site could be transformed in a similar way to the Nazi concentration camps that were opened to the public after World War II, “so that people don’t forget the horror.”"
27,Brexit Turmoil Intensifies as Court Rebukes Boris Johnson,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 10:16:41 +0000",Mark Landler,"In a major blow to the prime minister, the court ruled unanimously that Parliament is still in session, whatever Mr. Johnson might think.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/uk-supreme-court-brexit.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — Britain’s highest court, in an extraordinary rebuke that deepened the country’s convulsive debate over Brexit, ruled on Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully when he suspended Parliament in his unyielding drive to pull Britain out of the European Union. Mr. Johnson, determined to make a break from Europe by the end of next month whatever the cost, had maneuvered to cut out the lawmakers, many of whom opposed his damn-the-torpedoes approach, in the weeks before the deadline to withdraw from the union. But the British Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the prime minister had overstepped, and effectively declared Parliament back in session. As lawmakers prepared to reconvene on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson, facing calls to resign, said he would cut short a trip to the United Nations and return home. [Parliament to reconvene after the Supreme Court delivered a stinging blow to Boris Johnson. Follow our live coverage.] The ruling was more than just another political blow to a leader who has suffered more than his share of setbacks. It was a seminal legal moment in Britain, where the courts have historically steered clear of political disputes, and vivid evidence of how the anguished debate over Brexit has strained Britain’s most hallowed public institutions. Most immediately, the ruling raised questions about the future of Mr. Johnson, who was already reeling after multiple defeats in Parliament, a rebellion in his own Conservative Party, and new questions about his ties to a young businesswoman when he was mayor of London. Speaking before a meeting with President Trump at the United Nations, Mr. Johnson said he disagreed “profoundly” with the ruling and would forge ahead with his plans to leave the bloc. But he added, “Let’s be absolutely clear, we respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court.” Mr. Trump, who has cultivated Mr. Johnson as a like-minded populist, played down the significance of the decision. Noting that he had lost several cases in the United States Supreme Court before gaining some victories, Mr. Trump said, “For him, it’s another day in the office.” Still, the debate over whether and how to leave the European Union, which voters agreed to do in a June 2016 referendum, proved the undoing of Mr. Johnson’s two predecessors as divided Britons took to the street to protest. Now, he faces an uncertain future as he ventures back into Parliament. On Tuesday, at the same time the prime minister was meeting with Mr. Trump, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, told a cheering audience at his party’s conference that Mr. Johnson had “misled the country” and would soon become “the shortest-serving prime minister there’s ever been.” Mr. Johnson reiterated his call for a general election, but there were no signs he was any closer to winning the necessary two-thirds approval in Parliament to schedule a vote. Parliament seemed likely to lapse back into paralysis as the deadline for Britain’s exit from the European Union — Oct. 31 — draws closer. Defenders of the prime minister complained that the court ruling would weaken his hand in negotiating an exit deal with Brussels. That contention seemed debatable, given the deep gulf between the two sides, but the court’s decision certainly tarnishes him at home, at a time when his other stumbles have yet to dent his popularity. Unlike in the United States, there is little precedent in Britain for judicial review of government decisions. That had led political and legal analysts to speculate that the court might decide it had no authority to rule on the prime minister’s actions, or to deliver a limited rebuke. Instead, the court’s 11 justices cast aside this tradition of restraint and delivered an unsparing denunciation of the government’s actions, and an unequivocal victory for the prime ministers’ opponents. “The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification,” said the court’s president, Lady Hale, using the British term for suspending the body. “The prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect,” she said, declaring that Parliament was no longer suspended. But with so many forces at play, members of Parliament were uncertain how the situation might unfold when the House of Commons went back into session. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, said the chamber would meet Wednesday, nearly three weeks earlier than the date Mr. Johnson had set. Mr. Bercow, who has been a thorn in the government’s side because of his habit of allowing backbenchers to influence the debate over Brexit, said the justices “have vindicated the right and duty of Parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinize the executive and hold ministers to account.” “As the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy,” he said, “the House of Commons must convene without delay.” While the lawmakers scrambled to plot strategy for their unexpected parliamentary session, legal analysts pored over the court’s written opinion to determine just how much it changed the landscape of British constitutional law. On first glance, the answer seemed to be: a great deal. “It’s striking and unprecedented and will send a shock wave through the U.K.’s democratic institutions,” said Raphael Hogarth, an associate at the Institute for Government, a research group. “There are some aspects of Parliament’s role in holding the executive to account that we previously thought were just established practice, or perhaps convention,” Mr. Hogarth said. “But what the Supreme Court has done today is rolled them into legal doctrine.” Mr. Johnson’s next move was not clear, and he did not rule out suspending Parliament again. While he professed respect for the courts, he complained that the decision reflected the views of those who opposed Brexit — and, by implication, the will of the British people, who voted narrowly to leave the bloc. “I think the most important thing is that we get on and deliver Brexit on Oct. 31, and clearly the claimants in this case are determined to try to frustrate that,” Mr. Johnson told reporters. Experts have warned that a British withdrawal from the bloc without a formal agreement with the European Union could do serious damage to the economy. Mr. Johnson has absorbed an extraordinary string of legal and political defeats since becoming prime minister in July. He lost a succession of Parliamentary votes, lost his majority in the House of Commons and lost the support of several members of his Conservative Party — including his own brother. A new threat emerged over the weekend, when The Sunday Times of London reported that when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, his office directed government grants and coveted spots in trade delegations to an entrepreneur, a young woman, whose apartment it said he often visited during working hours. The legal challenges to Mr. Johnson’s suspension of Parliament had begun almost immediately. This month, an English court ruled that the judiciary could not pass judgment on how or why Mr. Johnson had acted. But days later, Scotland’s highest civil court ruled that the suspension was an unlawful effort to stymie debate before the Brexit deadline, which Mr. Johnson has pledged to meet even if London and Brussels do not reach an agreement on the terms of a British withdrawal. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Johnson’s action was unjustified and that his motive did not matter. The timing of Parliament’s return is doubly bad for Mr. Johnson because the Conservatives are scheduled to hold their annual conference early next week to showcase the party’s policies ahead of a possible general election. Unless the prime minister can assemble an unlikely majority to suspend Parliament again, that set-piece event may now clash with parliamentary proceedings. Mr. Johnson planned to cut short his New York trip and fly back to London on Tuesday night, after deliberating by phone with his cabinet, government officials said. The next-to-last speaker at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson conspicuously avoided talking about the political earthquake at home. Rather, in what seemed like an improvised address, he warned of the consequences of technology created without ethical underpinnings, likening it to the story of Prometheus in Greek mythology, who is punished for his transgressions by an eagle that repeatedly eats his liver. “And this went on forever — a bit like the experience of Brexit in the U.K., if some of our parliamentarians had their way,” Mr. Johnson joked, in his one reference to Britain’s chaos. As a practical matter, it was not clear how much the court decision would change the government’s immediate approach to Brexit. In the days before they were dispersed, members of the House of Commons pushed through a law — over the prime minister’s fierce opposition — that would prohibit Mr. Johnson from pursuing a “no-deal Brexit.” In symbolic terms, though, the court ruling was a stinging rebuke. It raised the question of whether he had misled the queen in asking her to suspend Parliament. And it added to the perception that his government was willing to run roughshod over Britain’s political conventions in its zeal to extract the country from Europe. Before his meeting with Mr. Trump, an American reporter asked Mr. Johnson if he planned to resign because of his handling of the matter. “That was a very nasty question,” Mr. Trump interjected. Mr. Johnson, however, was more understanding. “I think he was asking a question, to be fair, that a lot of British reporters would have asked,” he said."
28,"For Sale: Elegant Country Homes, Downton Abbey-Adjacent","Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:37:33 +0000",Peter Wilson,Sellers in a rural corner of England hope the “sprinkle of glamour” from the movie sequel to the TV series will bring a new wave of buyers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/realestate/for-sale-country-homes-downton-abbey-adjacent.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — As “Downton Abbey” moves from the television screen to movie theaters, the real-life setting of the period drama is bracing for a renewed surge of interest. Highclere Castle, the grand English country house in Hampshire that is used as the fictional home of the Crawley family, has drawn hundreds of thousands of paying visitors since the drama made its debut on television in 2010. The recent release of its follow-up movie is certain to extend the fascination with Julian Fellowes’s “upstairs downstairs” story of life in a stately country home, and experts say that the renewed buzz will most likely lift interest in real estate in the area, too. The Highclere Estate, about 65 miles west of London, and the nearby lush green lanes and pretty pubs and churches have always been unbilled co-stars of the “Downton” phenomenon. “There are now a lot of privately owned period properties on the edge of estates like Highclere or in the surrounding villages that get a lot of advantages from being so close,” said Mark Lawson, a partner at the Buying Solution, a buying advisory firm. “A lot of stately homes were obviously built in beautiful areas to begin with, and many of those areas are now quite special, because they have been protected over the centuries because of their historical significance,” he said. Research by the Halifax bank during the final season of “Downton Abbey” in 2015 found that the “halo effect” generated by interest in the drama was broad; over the preceding decade, the prices of properties around other stately homes had risen 39 percent, or nearly twice the national average of 22 percent. “We don’t have clients saying ‘I want to buy a house near Downton Abbey!’ but we do notice that a lot of people are more aware of these properties because of the show,” Mr. Lawson said. “At the moment, I have American and Indian clients who I know are certainly aware of Highclere because of ‘Downton Abbey.’” Nick Loweth, the head of the Knight Frank office in Hungerford, nine miles from Highclere Estate, said that he had noticed a general increase in interest and awareness of the area since the show began. “People come here for other reasons, like all the good schools in the area and the natural beauty and tranquillity of the place, and the fact that you really are in the countryside but you can still commute into London,” he said. “But it has to help that they are starting off with mental images of the place and a vague idea of its history.” Damian Gray, the head of Knight Frank’s North Thames and Chiltern region, said he believed that the TV drama had a particularly clear effect on Bampton, the Oxfordshire village that plays the role of Downton village in both the series and the movie. “Before ‘Downton Abbey,’ Bampton wasn’t at all on the map,” he said. “The show has added a sprinkle of glamour and encouraged both buyers and tourists to the area.” “Buyers from the U.K., U.S. and Asia do now come looking for property in Bampton,” Mr. Gray said. “It often comes up in conversation when potential buyers are listing off Oxfordshire villages and towns. ‘What’s that place that’s been on the TV?’ is something you often hear.” Mr. Loweth said that any stardust from the “Downton” movie would be especially welcomed by sellers after three years of uncertainty since the Brexit referendum. “Sales have been picking up lately, and the weak pound is a big plus when it comes to foreign buyers, but all the uncertainty has obviously limited both supply and demand for attractive period properties,” he said. James Moran, who is hoping that the attention generated by the movie will help him sell his five-bedroom home in Highclere village, less than a mile from the castle, said that “before the ‘Downton’ story came along, almost nobody knew about Highclere Castle except a few avid historians.” “The TV show catapulted it into the top five best-known historical buildings in the country, so that sort of profile has to help the area,” he said. “Hopefully, the movie includes lots of shots of the countryside and the surrounding area, and that will make more people aware that this is a lovely place to live,” he added. While millions of Americans watched the TV series, Mr. Moran said he expected his house to appeal mainly to British buyers, especially those working in London. Mr. Moran has made that hourlong commute for 11 years, but he and his wife, Lou, are moving because the younger of their two sons is starting at a new school two hours away, in Dorset. Their home, Brookfields House, is set on 1.9 acres of manicured gardens and lawns and is on sale for 1.39 million pounds, or about $1.7 million. Dating to the 1700s, it has a dining room and a drawing room that are old enough to feature low ceilings and exposed beams, but its more modern elements include a large en suite bathroom off the master bedroom and a recently renovated entertainment room above a two-car garage. In the steady traffic heading to Highclere Castle, thousands of visitors have passed the “For Sale” sign for another property in the village: Pyke’s House. The two-story six-bedroom home with exterior stonework carries the initials of the first owner, the local brickmaker John Pyke, who had the house built in 1874 and also provided the bricks used to build Highclere Castle. Inside, the drawing room has a grand fireplace and views in three directions over two garden areas and a patio. Harry Fisher, an agent at Savills in Newbury, five miles from Highclere, said the sales campaign for the £1.75 million property “can only have been helped by the influx of visitors to the area.” Prices there have been stable, he said, because despite the Brexit uncertainty, “we have quite a robust local market, thanks to our good rail and road links and the excellent schools all around here.” Rose Cottage, in nearby Newtown Common, would appeal to any “Downton” fans who share the Crawley family’s love of horses. Its 2.6 acres have been configured into horse paddocks with extensive stables. Parts of the four-bedroom house are about 200 years old, while modern additions include a 10-year-old extension near the kitchen and several skylights. Pentico is a thatched-roof 18th-century two-bedroom home that one could imagine serving as the retirement haven of Downton’s former head butler, Mr. Carson. Originally made of wattle and daub but now plastered, the property has a simple interior layout and is listed Grade II, or worthy of preservation, with an asking price of £785,000. The surrounding fields are part of the Sydmonton Court estate owned by the composer and impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose holdings include the nearby Watership Down, the inspiration for another famous tale. Another property bordering Mr. Lloyd Webber’s estate is Woodside Farm in nearby North Sydmonton. The five-bedroom 18th-century home overlooks its own tennis court and large gardens, and is being marketed by Knight Frank for £1.45 million. For those with slightly grander property ambitions, Brockwell House, on the edge of Newbury, has an imposing layout featuring an indoor swimming pool and gym, a lawn tennis court, a well-appointed wine cellar and, like most of the period properties in the area, a cast-iron AGA range. After relatively recent extensions, the three-story home has seven bedrooms, including a large master that sprawls out into two dressing areas and a large bathroom, and a mahogany-lined office boasting a doorway hidden behind a movable bookshelf. It is on the market for £2.65 million through Mark Potter of Knight Frank’s Basingstoke office."
29,Kim Jong-un Visits South Korea? The South Says It Could Happen,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 03:45:07 +0000",Choe Sang-Hun,A visit by Kim Jong-un would be the first by a North Korean leader south of the Demilitarized Zone separating the two countries.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/asia/kim-jong-un-south-korea.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Jong-un could meet again with President Trump and even visit South Korea in November if expected talks between Pyongyang and Washington make progress on eliminating North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, South Korean intelligence officials told lawmakers on Tuesday. South Korean officials have been considering inviting Mr. Kim to a conference of Southeast Asian countries that is planned in Busan, a port city on the southeastern tip of South Korea, in November. Neither North Korea nor the United States has officially announced the resumption of dialogue. But after a monthslong hiatus, denuclearization talks between the two countries will most likely take place within “two or three weeks,” Kim Min-ki, a governing-party lawmaker, quoted intelligence officials as saying during a closed-door parliamentary hearing on Tuesday in Seoul, the South’s capital. If such talks lead to a breakthrough and Mr. Kim visits South Korea, it would be the first such trip by a North Korean leader to the South beyond the Demilitarized Zone and could give the party of South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, a lift ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April. When Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon met in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, last September, Mr. Kim promised to visit Seoul soon. But that promise was never fulfilled as subsequent talks between North Korea and the United States stalled over deep differences over how to denuclearize the North, damaging inter-Korean relations. North Korean officials have also recently indicated that talks with Washington could resume in coming weeks. If such working-level talks were successful, Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader could hold another summit this year, said Mr. Kim, the South Korean lawmaker. Lee Eun-jae, an opposition lawmaker who also attended the parliamentary session with intelligence officials, quoted them as saying that Kim Jong-un also “may come to Busan depending on the result of denuclearization talks” with Washington. Mr. Moon, the South Korean leader, has been desperate for a breakthrough in North Korean-United States talks in order to revive his signature policy of improving inter-Korean ties. He has been hit hard by a slew of domestic and external problems in recent months, including a slowing economy and a diplomatic row with Japan. His approval ratings have fallen in recent weeks after damaging reports in the news media around his appointment of Cho Kuk, one of his former presidential aides, as justice minister. On Monday, prosecutors raided Mr. Cho’s home to collect evidence on a flood of allegations of ethical lapses in his family that have dominated newspaper headlines for weeks. Mr. Moon’s political stock soared when he met Mr. Kim three times last year, helping arrange his summit meetings with Mr. Trump in an effort to work out a deal on dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons and establishing a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. But the enthusiasm for Mr. Moon’s approach cratered after Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump abruptly ended their second summit, in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February, without a deal on how fast and thoroughly North Korea should dismantle its nuclear program. North Korea has since rejected dialogue with South Korea, dismissing Mr. Moon’s role as mediator and calling him “officious” and “double-dealing.” Despite such slights, Mr. Moon has resumed his efforts to revive diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula, meeting on Monday with Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Mr. Moon said he hoped that working-level negotiations between the United States and North Korea could be held soon to lay the groundwork for another summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. But Mr. Trump indicated Monday that he wanted to know what he could achieve in another meeting with Mr. Kim before committing himself to another summit. “Right now, people would like to see that happen,” Mr. Trump said on the sidelines of the United Nations meeting. “I want to know what’s going to be coming out of it. We can know a lot before the summit takes place.” The mood for resuming dialogue with North Korea has improved since Mr. Trump  removed his hawkish national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and indicated that he might try a “new method” in negotiating with North Korea. Last week, the North’s nuclear envoy, Kim Myong-gil, praised Mr. Trump’s “wise political decision” and said he would like to be “optimistic” about coming talks with Washington."
30,German Court Says a Hangover Is an Illness,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 18:01:03 +0000",Mike Ives,The state court in Frankfurt ruled that an “anti-hangover shot” violated a ban on claiming that foods or supplements can cure human ailments.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/europe/germany-hangovers-illness-cure.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"The Oktoberfest party went late, and your brain now feels as fragile as antique pottery on a bumpy flight. So you reach for an “anti-hangover” supplement and hope that it holds up to its promise to cure you. But that promise is false advertising, a court in Frankfurt ruled on Monday. The court declared that a hangover is an illness, and it is illegal in Germany to claim that foods or supplements can cure human ailments or disease. The case involved the maker of a powder marketed as an “anti-hangover shot,” which claimed its product contained “plant extracts with antioxidants, electrolytes and vitamins” that could combat the nausea, headaches and drowsiness that often come after a long night of alcohol consumption. The decision of the Frankfurt upper court can be appealed, but beyond the ruling, much about the case is shrouded in mystery: Neither the company that made the purported hangover-fighting product nor the consumer watchdog that brought the case has been publicly identified. An illness is defined as “any, even minor or transient, disturbance of the normal nature or normal activity of the body,” the court found. This includes even “an insignificant or temporary disturbance of the normal condition that it can be eliminated or mitigated and which heals.” In other words, a hangover. A February study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, led by scientists in Germany, defined an alcohol-induced hangover as a complex of “unpleasant physical and mental symptoms” that take place when blood alcohol concentrations drop from a relatively high level to zero. There were no known effective medical treatments for those symptoms, the study said, adding that folky aphorisms about hangover prevention — such as “beer before wine and you’ll feel fine” — were scientifically unproven. Hangovers serve a valuable purpose, the study found. That throbbing headache and other forms of discomfort are a protective warning sign that has compelled humans to modify future behavior, the study concluded, and in that way “pass on this evolutionary advantage to next generations.” While the German court decided that it was in the interest of public health to expand the definition of “illness” as broadly as possible, the ruling will do little to comfort drinkers worldwide, including those who have descended on the southern German city of Munich for the 186th annual Oktoberfest. The festival began on Saturday by opening 38 tents that serve beer, roast chicken and giant pretzels. There are also costume parades of the traditional Alpine peasant garb that is increasingly trendy among Bavarian Millennials, concerts and an amusement park with games and rides. Every year, there is also an ecumenical church service offering “prayer instead of beer,” but without any suggestion that it will help ease a hangover."
31,"What Is the United Nations? Its History, Its Goals and Its Relevance","Tue, 24 Sep 2019 20:51:24 +0000",Somini Sengupta,A brief look at what the 193-member United Nations does and how it works as leaders convene in New York for the annual General Assembly.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/world/americas/what-is-the-united-nations.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"Now in its seventh decade, the United Nations is well known throughout the world. But how many people know what it does or how it works? Or why, as nearly 200 leaders converge this week for the 74th session of its annual General Assembly, the institution has struggled to keep the promise of its founders: making the world better and more peaceful? The United Nations Charter was signed at a conference in San Francisco in June 1945, led by Britain, China, the Soviet Union and the United States. When the Charter took effect on Oct. 24 of that year, a global war had just ended. Much of Africa and Asia was still ruled by colonial powers. After fierce negotiations, 50 nations agreed to a Charter that begins, “We the peoples of the United Nations.” That opening line is notable because today, the United Nations can, to some, seem to serve the national interests of its 193 members — especially the most powerful. Their priorities can stand in the way of fulfilling the Charter’s first two pledges: to end “the scourge of war” and to regain “faith in fundamental human rights.” In 1948, the United Nations proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These include the right to not be enslaved, the right to free expression, and the right to seek from other countries asylum from persecution. According to the United Nations Foundation, it is the most translated document in the world. However, many of the rights expressed — to education, to equal pay for equal work, to nationality — remain aspirational. Each fall, the United Nations General Assembly, the main decision-making body of the organization where each member has one vote, becomes the stage where presidents and prime ministers give speeches that can be soaring, clichéd, or somewhere in between. Despite the recommended 15-minute time limit, many leaders exceed it. Some have delivered long, incoherent tirades, such as one given by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan strongman, in 2009. (The longest General Assembly speech ever given was by Fidel Castro, at four hours and 29 minutes, on Sept. 26, 1960.) At last year’s General Assembly, President Donald J. Trump delivered a speech that sharply criticized multilateralism, a cornerstone of the international cooperation espoused by the United Nations. “America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control and domination,” he declared. In 2017, Mr. Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies. The General Assembly speeches offer plenty of star power, but critics contend that they amount to little more than a glorified gabfest. For the rest of the session, the General Assembly is the arena where largely symbolic diplomatic jousts are won and lost. Hundreds of resolutions are introduced annually. While some earn a great deal of attention — like one in 1975 that equated Zionism with racism — they are not legally binding. In principle, nations small and large, rich and poor, have equal voice in the Assembly. But the genuine power resides elsewhere. The 15-member Security Council is by far the most powerful arm of the United Nations. It can impose sanctions, as it has done against North Korea over its nuclear arsenal and missiles, and authorize military intervention, as it did against Libya in 2011. Critics say it also is the most anachronistic part of the organization. Its five permanent members, known as the P5, are the victors of World War II: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. The other 10 members are elected for two-year terms, with seats set aside for different regions of the world. Efforts to expand the permanent membership to include powers that have emerged since 1945 — such as India, Japan and Germany — have been stymied. For every country that vies for a seat, rivals seek to block it. Any member of the permanent five can veto any measure, and each has regularly used this power to protect either itself or allies. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has cast a veto 16 times on Council resolutions, many concerning Israeli-Palestinian relations. Russia has done so 22 times in that period. The Security Council’s job is to maintain international peace. Its ability to do so has been severely constrained in recent years, largely because of bitter divisions between Russia and the West. The Council has been unable to defuse major conflicts, particularly those in which permanent members have a stake. Most recently, its starkest failure has been the handling of the nearly nine-year-old conflict in Syria, with Russia backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and the United States, Britain and France supporting some opposition groups. It also failed to halt the fighting in Yemen between its Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led coalition, despite a disastrous humanitarian situation and reports from its own investigators of war crimes on both sides. North Korea, an ally of China, has also consistently defied the United Nations, ignoring prohibitions against its nuclear program and missile tests. The Charter is vague in defining the duties of the secretary general, the United Nations’ top official. Nine people have held the position, all men. The secretary general is expected to show no favoritism to any particular country, but the office is largely dependent on the funding and good will of the most powerful nations. The Security Council — notably its five permanent members — chooses the secretary general, by secret ballot, to serve a maximum of two five-year terms. It is difficult for the secretary general to remain independent of the P5’s influence. Without a military force, the secretary general’s coercive power is limited, but the position enjoys a bully pulpit. The current secretary general, António Guterres, a Portuguese politician now in his third year, has sought most conspicuously to advance international cooperation against warming temperatures. At a climate summit Mr. Guterres convened on Monday, he told participants that without more aggressive action their grandchildren would suffer, and “I refuse to be an accomplice in the destruction of their one and only home.” The United Nations Climate Action Summit at the General Assembly on Monday meant to highlight concrete promises by leaders to wean the global economy from fossil fuels to avoid the worst effects of global warming. The United States, having vowed to pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the pact among nations to jointly fight climate change, said nothing at all. A host of countries made only incremental promises. In 2015, the General Assembly also unanimously endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals, a 17-item list of 2030 objectives that includes addressing climate change, pollution, poverty and hunger; and eliminating gender discrimination. Mr. Guterres is using part of this year’s General Assembly to sound the alarm that the deadline could be missed. “We are not on track,” he said. “We are not doing enough.”"
32,U.S. Seeks More Sanctions on Venezuela’s Leaders and Faults Europe’s Inertia,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:39:01 +0000",Lara Jakes,Latin American nations and the United States cleared the way for more sanctions against loyalists to President Nicolás Maduro. But Europe has yet to follow.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/americas/us-venezuela-europe-united-nations.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"The Trump administration opened a double-barreled critique on Monday of what it described as a limp European response to the crisis in Venezuela, renewing demands for tougher sanctions against President Nicolás Maduro’s government and more aid for refugees. The broadsides, delivered as leaders arrived for the annual United Nations General Assembly, sought to re-energize global support for Venezuelan opposition leaders who have been trying since January to oust Mr. Maduro from power. Several European officials agreed that far more needed to be done to help the nearly seven million Venezuelans in desperate need of food, safe water and medical supplies. But they stopped far short of embracing any new sanctions against Mr. Maduro and his loyalists, including some who have assets in Europe. The numbers of refugees fleeing Venezuela — expected to grow to five million by the end of 2019 — “are terrifying,” Edita Hrda, a European Union diplomat, told an Atlantic Council forum in New York. But she said attention to Venezuela largely has been limited to the Western Hemisphere, and noted that plans to broaden assistance would be a focus of a conference in Brussels in late October. That drew a retort from John Barsa, who oversees assistance to Venezuela for the United States Agency for International Development. He described meeting a pregnant Venezuelan woman last month in a Colombian border town who needed care. “The first thing coming out of her mouth was not ‘How’s the conference planning going?’” Mr. Barsa said. He said the Western Hemisphere “has never seen human suffering on such a staggering level. The international community cannot turn a blind eye to this human tragedy.” Hours later, top diplomats from the United States and Latin America voted to begin a legal process, based in the so-called Rio Treaty, a regional security compact, to impose additional regional sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s government. The Trump administration endorsed the use of the Rio Treaty earlier this month. The last time it was invoked was after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Of the 19 nations that are signatories to the treaty, 16 voted on Monday to broadly investigate and penalize people connected to Mr. Maduro’s government who are accused of money laundering, illegal drug trafficking, terrorism and transnational organized crime. Uruguay voted against the measure, Trinidad and Tobago abstained and Cuba was absent. “We know that exceptional situations require exceptional responses,” said Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo of Brazil. He said the crisis in Venezuela “includes clear and growing elements that threaten peace and the security of our region.” The treaty allows for additional diplomatic pressure and economic punishment to be brought against violators, such as those implicated in organized crime. It also opens the door to a possible military response, although American officials maintain that is not currently being considered, and the Venezuelan opposition’s official for foreign affairs, Julio Borges, said on Monday that the process needed to advance “step by step.” President Trump will lead a meeting on Venezuela at the United Nations on Wednesday, in his most visible step in the United States’ pressure campaign against Mr. Maduro. The effort has included multiple rounds of sanctions; support for the claim of the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, to be interim president; and most recently, attempts to convince Europe to intensify its own sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s loyalists. European officials had pledged to expand the economic punishment against Mr. Maduro’s government after political talks brokered by Norway collapsed last week. One senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy frankly, said Monday that new European sanctions were not expected until sometime in October at the earliest. European officials were likely to move first to use sanctions to punish Mr. Maduro for human rights violations, stemming from the June death of a Venezuelan Navy captain who was accused of plotting a rebellion. The United States and a vast majority of Latin American nations are also pushing for the freezing of bank accounts and other assets that Mr. Maduro’s loyalists have in Europe, where the senior American official said some have moved their families to live comfortably — and far from the perilous conditions in Venezuela. Juan Pablo de Laiglesia, a senior diplomat from Spain, said Europe was still considering issuing new sanctions against Venezuela on the grounds of human rights violations for the death of the navy captain, whose lawyers accused the government of torture. As to the broader sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s loyalists and their assets in Europe, “it will depend on the situation and how it evolves,” Mr. de Laiglesia said in an interview."
33,Spain Arrests 9 in Catalonia on Suspicion of Plotting Violence,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 22:29:02 +0000",The Associated Press,"The Spanish police gave few details of the arrests, and prosecutors said the raids were aimed at gathering evidence of a pro-independence group’s “advanced preparation for terrorist acts.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/europe/spain-catalonia-arrests.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"The Spanish police arrested on Monday nine activists linked to pro-Catalan independence groups on suspicion they may have been preparing to commit violent acts, possibly with explosives, and Spanish prosecutors called for rebellion and terrorism charges to be leveled against them. A statement from the Guardia Civil, the Spanish national police, said the operation in Barcelona Province was part of an investigation into the Committees for the Defense of the Republic, a grass-roots organization that supports Catalonia’s independence from Spain. In the past, the group has organized street protests and blocked road and rail lines. The police said they carried out 10 raids and seized an abundance of material and substances they believe could be used to make explosives. If confirmed, it would be a considerable blow to Catalonia’s mainstream independence movement, which is proud of its overwhelmingly peaceful approach since it began gathering momentum in 2011. National Court prosecutors said the raids were aimed at gathering evidence to demonstrate the C.D.R.’s “advanced preparation for terrorist acts in connection with their secessionist aims.” The police statement gave few details, saying there was a judicial secrecy blanket order on the case. And the police did not say when the group may have been planning the acts of violence. Major protests in Catalonia are expected in the coming weeks, when Spain’s Supreme Court issues its verdict in the trial of 12 ex-Catalan officials and activists charged for attempting to establish an independent Catalan republic in 2017. The prosecutors said the operation was aimed at stopping expected C.D.R. activities around the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 2017, independence referendum, declared illegal by the Spanish government and courts, in Catalonia and publication of the trial verdict. They said the C.D.R.’s activities could have caused “irreparable damage given the advanced state of their preparations.” The C.D.R. issued a statement saying the arrests and raids were a bid to “silence” them and called for protests against what they described as Spanish state repression. In response, more than 100 people gathered in the Catalan town of Sabadell and shouted insults at the police carrying out one of the raids. Spain’s two main center-right parties welcomed the police operation while two Catalan pro-independence parties demanded that the caretaker interior minister, Fernando Grande Marlaska, appear in Parliament to explain the operation. Catalonia’s pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra, criticized the arrests. “Repression continues to be the sole response of the Spanish state,” he tweeted. “They are trying to construct a tale of violence prior to the sentences. They won’t achieve it. The independence movement is, and always will be, pacific.”"
34,"In Israel, Gantz and Netanyahu Start Talks on Possible Unity Government","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:26:41 +0000",Isabel Kershner,"After Israel’s deadlock election, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief opponent, Benny Gantz, agreed to try to negotiate a power-sharing deal.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/middleeast/israel-election-rivlin-netanyahu-gantz.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief opponent, Benny Gantz, agreed Monday to begin talks for a possible power-sharing deal after last week’s election left Israel in political gridlock. After meeting for more than two hours at the office of President Reuven Rivlin, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz issued a joint statement saying that they had “discussed ways to advance Israel’s unity” at Mr. Rivlin’s behest, and that their negotiating teams would meet on Tuesday. [Update: Netanyahu is chosen to form Israel’s next government.] But serious obstacles remain, not least the question of who would serve first as prime minister under a possible agreement to rotate the premiership. Mr. Rivlin, who has been calling for a unity government, called the meeting “ a significant step forward.” “The people expect you to find a solution and to prevent further elections, even if it comes at a personal and even ideological cost,” he admonished the two candidates, adding: “A shared and equal government is possible. It can and it must express the different voices in society.” He invited Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu to meet again at his residence on Wednesday. Mr. Rivlin’s role is largely ceremonial, but after last week’s inconclusive vote it is up to him to decide who will get the first crack at forming a government and becoming prime minister. For now he appears to have deferred that decision in the hope that the two men, whose parties won the most votes in the election, can work out a deal on their own. “This is one of the rare instances where the president has a chance to be more than a rubber stamp,” said Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Israel Democracy Institute and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A unifying and soothing voice whose office normally elevates him above Israel’s political and social fray, Mr. Rivlin has said his conclusion, based on the election results, was that the divided public had in essence voted for a government of national unity that includes both major parties — Mr. Gantz’s centrist Blue and White, and Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz support the idea of a unity government in principle, but on different, and possibly mutually exclusive, terms. Mr. Gantz has said that he would not join a coalition with Mr. Netanyahu as long as he is facing possible indictment in three corruption cases. He has also said that he wanted to form a broad, secular coalition, excluding ultra-Orthodox parties. Mr. Netanyahu could be charged in the corruption cases in a matter of weeks. And he promised his right-wing and religious coalition partners last week that they would stick together in coalition negotiations. One of the ultra-Orthodox parties in the group has vowed not to sit in a government with the no. 2 in Blue and White, Yair Lapid. Ultimately, any arrangement between Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu would require a level of trust, Mr. Rahat said, that he said would be “difficult to build between them.” But the meeting and joint photos on Monday began to normalize the idea that Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu could conceivably sit together in a joint government. “The entire conflict at the moment revolves around who will serve first as prime minister and who will serve second,” Avigdor Liberman, the leader of a secular nationalist party, said on Facebook after an earlier meeting with Mr. Gantz on Monday. In a message to his party members after the meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gantz wrote, “We have no intention of relinquishing our lead,” suggesting that he will insist on being first. Mr. Rivlin will receive the final, official results of the Sept. 17 election on Wednesday. He then has up to seven days to appoint a candidate to form a government. If Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu have reached an agreement by then, he would presumably go along with their choice. Mr. Rivlin, 80, an often jovial Likud veteran and former Parliament speaker, is known to be no fan of Mr. Netanyahu’s. The pair have a long history of personal and political rivalry. As party leader, Mr. Netanyahu tried to block Mr. Rivlin’s candidacy in the presidential election in 2014, even looking into the possibility of abolishing the presidency. But Mr. Rivlin is considered fair and professional, and enjoys the public’s confidence. In Israel Democracy Institute surveys, the presidency consistently polls as Israel’s most trusted institution after the military. The president’s call to Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz on Monday came soon after a parade of party representatives finished making their recommendations to Mr. Rivlin about whom they supported to form the next government. Under the law, he can choose any elected lawmaker he believes has the best chance of forming a stable coalition, though traditionally the appointment has gone to the head of the party or alliance of parties with the most seats in Parliament. Blue and White came out of the election with 33 seats, slightly ahead of Likud’s 31, but neither party gained enough support from smaller, allied parties to command a majority of 61 in the 120-seat Parliament. By the end of their consultations with Mr. Rivlin, Mr. Netanyahu had the support of parties holding 55 seats, compared with 54 for Mr. Gantz. Mr. Liberman, whose Yisrael Beiteinu party won eight seats, has refrained from taking sides, hoping to play kingmaker. He advocates a secular unity government led by Likud and Blue and White that excludes Mr. Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox allies. After an election in April produced similarly divided results, Mr. Rivlin tapped Mr. Netanyahu to form a governing coalition, but he was unable to, leading to the new vote last week. In one of the many twists of this redo election, Arab lawmakers abandoned 27 years of noninvolvement on Sunday and recommended Mr. Gantz. They have no love of him and said they would not join in a government led by him, but they do want to unseat Mr. Netanyahu. With its 13 seats, the Joint List, an alliance of predominantly Arab parties, momentarily gave Mr. Gantz’s parliamentary bloc the support of 57 lawmakers, but by Monday morning things had changed. Three lawmakers from the most hard-line party in the alliance opposed the recommendation, taking Mr. Gantz down to 54. At a party meeting in Parliament on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu repeated his call for a unity government. After running a divisive campaign, he said unity required “an outstretched hand for true national reconciliation.” Pointing to the great discretion the president has to shape that process, an Israeli political reporter for the Walla news site, Tal Shalev, posted a reminder on Twitter on Monday that the law does not require Mr. Rivlin to appoint the head of the largest party, or the contender with the most recommendations. Mr. Rivlin replied, “I believe you’re right, dear Tal.”"
35,A Simple Regimen Can Prevent TB. Why Aren’t More People on It?,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 12:48:04 +0000",Apoorva Mandavilli,"Two antibiotics, taken for a month, can stop a leading killer. But “when it’s for TB, people just sort of shrug.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/health/tuberculosis-prevention.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"Tuberculosis struck 10 million people worldwide in 2017, killing 1.6 million of them — a toll greater than that of H.I.V., malaria, measles and Ebola combined. TB is the leading infectious killer around the globe; nearly 1.8 billion people are carrying the bacterium that causes the disease. The world is sorely in need of new ways to prevent TB, not just treat it. Drugs to stave off the infection do exist, but the monthslong regimens are difficult and people often do not finish the prescribed courses. That may soon change: A new drug course, lasting just one month, is just as effective as longer regimens at preventing TB, scientists reported earlier this year. The results have left experts hoping for new progress against a disease that has been an intractable enemy for centuries. “I think it’s a moment of really extraordinary promise,” said Mike Frick, co-lead for TB at Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization. Among the plagues sweeping developing countries, TB has often taken a back seat to competing and urgent priorities, especially H.I.V. (The two are linked: H.I.V. patients account for one in five TB deaths worldwide.) In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug to treat the deadliest strain of TB — but it was the first approval for a TB drug in more than 40 years. Diagnostic tests for the infection are not sensitive and mostly rely on sputum, which many sick people struggle to produce. And prevention? “It’s really downplayed and it’s ignored, and it’s ignored to a degree that is scandalous,” said Dr. Richard Chaisson, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] One challenge is identifying those who should receive preventive drugs. The drugs are the clear choice for the most vulnerable groups: people with H.I.V.; people whose immune systems are compromised because they take biologic drugs for Crohn’s disease, arthritis or other diseases; and young children and others who share a home with someone infected. Protection for these groups should last at least five years, studies suggest.  But one in three people worldwide harbor the TB bacteria, and just one in 10 will go on to develop the disease. Who among them should be treated?  “The biggest issue has been to identify those 10 percent,” said Dr. Eliud Wandwalo, senior coordinator for TB at the nonprofit Global Fund. “We don’t have any good indicator to show you which of these people who are infected might progress and become sick.” For many people who are healthy, or who simply feel healthy, the drugs have been a tough sell. For decades, the standard course has been an antibiotic called isoniazid that kills the bacteria causing TB only when they are replicating. The drug must be taken daily for nine months, in the hope of catching the bacteria as they multiply, and it can cause numbness, nausea and fever. Isoniazid also can cause liver toxicity, so people taking it are advised not to drink alcohol for the entire nine months.  “Traditionally, completion rates have been very poor,” said Dr. Alison Grant, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Doctors sometimes decline to prescribe the antibiotic because of worries about exposing otherwise healthy people to the side effects, or contributing to a rise in drug-resistant bacteria if patients don’t complete the full course. Both those concerns are unfounded, said Dr. Grant. Doctors “just stay away from it, despite the evidence showing otherwise.” In the past decade, scientists have come up with two shorter courses: a drug called rifampin taken every day for four months; or a combination of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken once weekly for three months. Still, for some people, remembering to take the pills — and all 11 pills together — once a week can be more challenging than taking them every day, Dr. Grant said. An alternative emerged in March, when Dr. Chaisson and his colleagues published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine showing that a regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken daily for one month, is as effective at preventing TB, safer and more likely to be completed than the traditional nine-month course of isoniazid. The World Health Organization met to review this new regimen in July and is expected to endorse it later this year. The study was conducted only in people infected with H.I.V., however, and it is likely that the W.H.O. will approve the regimen only for those patients. Dr. Chaisson thinks preventive drugs should be given to a far larger population. “If we had an intervention for H.I.V. that reduces mortality by 37 percent, the W.H.O. would have an emergency meeting and it would be recommended for uptake in the entire world,” he said. “But when it’s for TB, people just sort of shrug.” “It’s just a stolid world of never-changing practices — slow to adopt, slow to change, slow to evolve,” Dr. Chaisson added. Cost is another hurdle. The one- and three-month courses both rely on rifapentine, made by Sanofi. In 2013, after a yearlong advocacy campaign to lower the costs, Sanofi dropped the price of rifapentine in the three-month course from $71 to $32. The new one-month course requires more rifapentine overall than the three-month regimen, and so is more expensive. Advocates and global health organizations are in intense negotiations with Sanofi to lower the cost to just $15 for the entire one-month treatment course. At least two companies are said to be developing generic versions, which also may bring down the cost. Without a lower price, donors like the federal government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) are unlikely to support the new course.  Still, experts said they are more optimistic about TB prevention than ever before. Just a year ago, funding organizations still presented countries with a false choice between prioritizing antiretroviral therapy for H.I.V. and preventive therapy for TB, said Dr. Chaisson. But Pepfar has begun to prioritize TB prevention. National governments will have to follow in order to turn back TB.  South Africa has shown what political will can accomplish, said Dr. Gavin Churchyard, a TB specialist based in Johannesburg. The country once had an abysmal TB preventive therapy program, with just a few thousand people taking the pills.  But in 2008, after Pakishe Aaron Motsoaledi, then the country’s health minister, made TB prevention a national priority, the numbers began to rise dramatically. By 2011, 350,000 people were enrolled in preventive therapy. Today, South Africa still has the world’s largest TB preventive therapy program, Dr. Churchyard said. Dr. Chaisson did a “back-of-the-envelope” calculation, published in 2017 in the Lancet Global Health, suggesting that if such preventive therapy had been rolled out worldwide, several million deaths could have been averted. “It makes the deaths that they incurred because of AIDS denialism in South Africa look so small,” Dr. Churchyard said. “Really, our neglect has cost lives, unfortunately. And it’s time — just as there was a time to end AIDS denialism, it’s time to end the TB denialism.”"
36,"Boris Johnson Faces a New Scandal, and ‘People See Blood in the Water’","Tue, 24 Sep 2019 16:09:16 +0000",Benjamin Mueller,"The prime minister has long turned controversy into opportunity, but his friendship with an American woman carries hints of financial improprieties.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/europe/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — On Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s turbulent path to Downing Street, serial philandering and ethical sloppiness became part of his schtick, blots on a career so chaotic and beguiling that the British public always seemed to forgive the mistakes. But Mr. Johnson is now facing a potentially more serious accusation of mixing friendship with a young woman and misspent public money, one that could test voters’ patience in a looming general election. In an article published this weekend,  The Sunday Times of London reported that, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, his office directed tens of thousands of pounds in government money to a fledgling entrepreneur and close friend whose apartment he often visited during working hours. The entrepreneur, Jennifer Arcuri, an American and a former model, was 27 when she first crossed paths with Mr. Johnson in 2012. In the ensuing years, she was given coveted spots on trade missions with the mayor to Tel Aviv, New York, Singapore and Malaysia. In some instances, Mr. Johnson’s office intervened to add her to the roster even though she did not meet the criteria for trade delegates, The Sunday Times reported. Even with lawmakers consumed by the fight over Brexit, the scandal gathered steam on Monday. On a plane to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Johnson repeatedly refused to answer reporters’ questions about the article, including whether he was in a sexual relationship with Ms. Arcuri at the time. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, accused the prime minister of an “alleged abuse of power.” And the British Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which this year awarded Ms. Arcuri’s company a grant of 100,000 pounds, or about $125,000, intended for British firms, said it was investigating the grant after The Sunday Times reported that Ms. Arcuri had vacated the company’s registered address in England and now lives in California. Mr. Johnson has previously weathered one scandal after another, building a buffer from his aura of chronic absent-mindedness and posh eccentricity. But he has spent considerable political capital in trying to enforce an Oct. 31 deadline for Brexit, and in the process provoked Parliament and the courts to try to check his power grab. Analysts said that Mr. Johnson was left vulnerable for the first time in his two-decade political career. “This goes into a new category — it’s no longer just the tabloid sex scandal thing,” said Sonia Purnell, the author of “Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition.” “Every single ingredient there is alarming. And the fact that he will not answer any questions — or indeed deny any of those allegations — I think that is why some people see blood in the water.” The scandal came in the midst of a tense week for the prime minister. He is trying to secure a new Brexit deal with European leaders. An early election is approaching. And the Supreme Court is set to rule on Tuesday on whether Mr. Johnson’s decision to suspend, or prorogue, Parliament at the height of the Brexit crisis was legal. That shutdown was originally intended to keep lawmakers from interfering with his plans to yank Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, with or without a deal governing future relations. But it now serves a second purpose in shielding the prime minister from a very public interrogation over the government grants. “The fact he’s prorogued Parliament means no one can call him to account,” Ms. Purnell said. As mayor, Mr. Johnson was barred from giving friends improper benefits. He was also bound to declare any private entanglements that could have created conflicts of interest. Hacker House, a cybersecurity company set up by Ms. Arcuri, did not respond to a message on Monday seeking comment. She told The Sunday Times that the grants “were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.” The Sunday Times reported that Ms. Arcuri arrived in London for business school after a short career in modeling and films. Her first venture — a series of networking events for entrepreneurs and policymakers in East London — was given a lift by Mr. Johnson, who appeared at four of her events, The Sunday Times reported. Soon a promotional agency overseen by the mayor began giving the company money. Mr. Johnson also paid regular visits to Ms. Arcuri’s East London apartment, which was outfitted with a dancing pole, sometimes during afternoon work breaks. The apartment building owner told The Sunday Times that Ms. Arcuri described Mr. Johnson as “one of her best friends.” And after Ms. Arcuri was turned down for a spot on a mayoral trade mission to Tel Aviv, Mr. Johnson’s office asked for her to be added, even though her professional experience had little to do with the trip. Mr. Johnson, who was mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, has occasionally mixed his elected positions with his dalliances before, as when he gave Helen Macintyre, an art adviser, an unpaid job as a fund-raiser for a public sculpture project. It was later revealed that Ms. Macintyre and Mr. Johnson had a child together. Earlier in his career, Mr. Johnson was fired from the Conservative Party’s leadership team after falsely denying reports of an extramarital affair. But these incidents only served to bolster Mr. Johnson’s image as a blustering and buffoonish, but always entertaining, lawmaker. “He’s got some sort of hold on the British psyche,” Ms. Purnell said. “He’s created this persona: the toff who quotes Latin. And no one really asks him what he’s doing, whether it’s a good idea. That’s what got him this far.” The Labour Party was already raising an alarm on Monday about parts of the British news media, particularly the British Broadcasting Corporation, giving Mr. Johnson a pass, though the BBC denied the allegation. “This is how the establishment works,” Mr. Corbyn said in a Twitter clip. “They close ranks.”"
37,Violent Protests in Papua Leave at Least 20 Dead,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 18:41:21 +0000",The Associated Press,"Rumors that a teacher insulted an indigenous student prompted an angry mob to torch local government buildings, shops and homes and set fire to cars and motorcycles.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/asia/papua-protests.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Violent protests by hundreds of people on Monday touched off by rumors that a teacher insulted an indigenous student in the restive Indonesian province of Papua have left at least 20 civilians dead, including three who were shot by the police, officials said. An angry mob torched local government buildings, shops and homes and set fire to cars and motorcycles on several roads leading to the district chief’s office in the city of Wamena, said the Papua police chief, Rudolf Alberth Rodja. A spokesman for the Papua military, Eko Daryanto, said at least 16 civilians, including 13 from other Indonesian provinces, were killed in Wamena, mostly after they were trapped in burning houses or shops. He said at least one soldier and three civilians had died in another protest in Jayapura, the provincial capital. About 65 civilians were injured in Wamena and five police officers were critically injured in Jayapura, he said. Conflicts between indigenous Papuans and Indonesian security forces are common in the impoverished Papua region, a former Dutch colony in the western half of New Guinea that is ethnically and culturally distinct from much of Indonesia. Television images showed orange flames and black smoke billowing from burning buildings in Wamena, and videos that circulated on the internet showed dozens of people, many armed with machetes, standing in front of shops and homes to protect them from the angry mob. Chief Rodja said the unrest was precipitated by rumors that a high school teacher in Wamena, who is not from Papua, called an indigenous student a “monkey” last week. He said a police investigation did not find any evidence of racism against the student, and he added that false rumors have been created and spread in other schools and indigenous communities with the intention of causing violent unrest. “This is a hoax, and I call on people in Papua not to be provoked by untrue news,” Chief Rodja told reporters in Jayapura, the capital of Papua Province. Mr. Daryanto said that a mob of angry students attacked a soldier and several police officers in Jayapura with machetes and rocks, and that security forces responded with gunfire, killing three civilians. The soldier died on the way to a hospital. At least five police officers were in critical condition. Joko Harjani, an airport official, said the protest forced the authorities to close the city’s airport until the situation returns to normal. The demonstration came days after the Indonesian authorities managed to bring the province under control after weeks of violent protests by thousands of people in Papua and West Papua provinces who had complained of racism toward Papuans. At least one Indonesian soldier and four civilians were killed in that violence. The previous protests were set off by videos circulated on the internet that showed security forces calling Papuan students “monkeys” and “dogs” in the East Java city of Surabaya, as they stormed a university dormitory where Papuan students were staying after a torn Indonesian flag was found in a sewer. The videos prompted hundreds of Papuans who study in other Indonesian provinces to return home, forcing a local state university to accommodate them. Papua was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a United Nations-sponsored ballot that was widely seen as a sham. Since then, a low-level insurgency has simmered in the mineral-rich region, which is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua. In recent years, some Papua students, including those who study in other provinces, have called for self-determination for their region."
38,Jeremy Corbyn Wins Brexit Showdown With His Labour Party,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 23:06:59 +0000",Stephen Castle,A full-scale revolt was defeated amid noisy protests over demands for the opposition party to campaign openly against leaving the European Union.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-brexit-labour-party.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"BRIGHTON, England — Jeremy Corbyn, Britain’s left-wing opposition leader, on Monday survived a serious challenge to his noncommittal approach to Brexit, winning a critical vote despite deep divisions at what most analysts expect to be the Labour Party’s last conference before a general election. Demands for Labour to campaign more openly against Brexit were ultimately defeated on Monday afternoon, amid noisy protests from party activists, and after two days of intrigue and infighting at the conference, including an abortive coup against the party’s centrist deputy leader, Tom Watson. After more than two hours of passionate debate on Monday, delegates finally drew back from inflicting defeat on Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong critic of the European Union who plans to face a general election with an ambiguous position intended to appeal to both those who want to stay in the bloc and to those who voted to leave it in a 2016 referendum. Monday’s decision endorses a policy under which, if Labour wins an election, the party would negotiate a new Brexit deal and put it to a second referendum with the alternative being to remain in the European Union. But Mr. Corbyn will not commit himself to campaigning one way or the other. The vote at the conference in Brighton, on England’s south coast, was a relief for Mr. Corbyn, whose leadership has been under pressure because of poor opinion poll ratings. But it could still be a Pyrrhic victory, because the ferocity of the debate has taken the shine off a gathering that was meant to showcase the party’s policy agenda, such as plans to reduce the working week, ahead of a general election that could come very soon. During the debate on Monday, several party members appealed for Labour to campaign clearly for Britain to remain in the European Union, and some argued that failure to do so would cost the party the next general election. But others stuck with the leadership’s position, suggesting that loyalty to Mr. Corbyn outweighed the desire of many Labour members and supporters for clearer opposition to Brexit. The critical decision was taken by a show of hands; despite protests from around the hall, calls for a more formal recorded ballot were rejected. The divisions have cast a cloud over a conference that had already been shadowed by internal acrimony. On Saturday, Mr. Watson said that he was the victim of an attempted “drive-by shooting” after he had learned by text message of an effort to abolish his job. Though Mr. Corbyn said he was not aware of the plot — and helped quash it the following day — the initiative came from Jon Lansman, a close ally of the Labour leader and the founder of Momentum, a pro-Corbyn pressure group. Divisions between Mr. Watson and Mr. Corbyn are well known. In targeting Mr. Watson, Labour leftists might have been trying to remove him from the picture as a possible successor in case Mr. Corbyn is eventually replaced, perhaps after a general election defeat. But tensions at the top of Mr. Corbyn’s team were also exposed when it emerged that Andrew Fisher, the head of policy, planned to resign and, according to British news reports, had accused colleagues of a “blizzard of lies” and of a “lack of professionalism, competence and human decency.” At the conference, the most pressing issue was Brexit, a policy that has long divided Labour because, while most activists and Labour voters support remaining in the European Union, many of its lawmakers represent parts of the north and middle of the country where a majority opted to leave. In trying to please everyone, however, critics argue that Labour is in danger of doing the opposite. Those who have urged the party to be clearer in its support for remaining include allies of Mr. Corbyn such as the party’s finance spokesman, John McDonnell, and its spokeswoman for foreign affairs, Emily Thornberry. In many respects, the debate reflects the growing polarization of an electorate that appears to be fleeing any possible center ground on Brexit and that is therefore demanding clear positions from party leaders. “Brexit identity has become the new dividing line in British politics,” said Sara Hobolt, a professor at the London School of Economics. “This is what people care about, this is what drives a lot of opinion. They feel more strongly about their political identity on Brexit lines — whether they are Remainers or Leavers — than whether they are Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat.” The dangers for Labour of sitting on the fence were illustrated by elections to the European Parliament in May, when the party finished third with just 14.1 percent of the vote. Since then, and under the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, the ruling Conservatives have become full-throated cheerleaders for Brexit, promising to pursue it — “do or die,” as Mr. Johnson has said — even if that means the sort of disorderly rupture it once insisted it would avoid. The newly resurgent pro-European Liberal Democrats want to scrap Brexit completely by canceling the 2016 referendum vote. That has put Labour in an increasingly difficult fight with the Liberal Democrats to win the Remain vote. Mr. Corbyn’s supporters point out that he has changed positions: He originally opposed a second referendum, which he is now supporting. But critics believe that his refusal to say how he would campaign or vote in any referendum is a liability for the party. Some activists have become exasperated at Mr. Corbyn’s policy gymnastics, saying that they would be almost impossible to explain to voters. During the 2017 general election, Mr. Corbyn performed better than most analysts predicted by campaigning against austerity rather than focusing on Brexit. But repeating that trick is likely to be harder next time, given the dominance of the issue. In the European Parliament elections, Ms. Hobolt said, as far as Brexit was concerned, “We saw that the parties that had the clearest and most unambiguous positions did best.” Voters are already shifting their allegiance based on their views on Europe, she added, noting that one survey showed less than 10 percent of Labour voters believed that the vote for Brexit was the right decision. That is down from an estimate of about 20 percent at the time of the 2016 referendum. “There has been some sorting,” she said. “What we are seeing with both main parties is that Remainers are leaving the Conservatives and Leavers are leaving Labour.”"
39,Nissan and Carlos Ghosn Settle S.E.C. Charges of Underreporting Compensation,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 18:06:52 +0000",Ben Dooley,The settlement is the latest fallout from Mr. Ghosn’s arrest in Japan on suspicion of attempting to hide part of his compensation from investors.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/business/sec-nissan-carlos-ghosn.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"TOKYO — The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Monday that it had reached a deal with Nissan to settle allegations that Nissan concealed from investors a plan to pay more than $140 million in retirement benefits to its former chairman, a scandal that led to criminal charges against the Japanese carmaker and rattled the world’s largest auto alliance. The company will pay a $15 million fine to settle the civil fraud charges. The former chairman who was to get the undisclosed compensation package, Carlos Ghosn, agreed to pay a $1 million penalty. The settlement is the latest fallout from the November arrest of Mr. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance of Nissan, Mitsubishi and Renault, on suspicion of trying to hide part of his compensation from investors and regulators. He is free on bail in Tokyo, where he faces four charges of financial wrongdoing. The S.E.C. opened its inquiry in January in response to charges brought by Japanese prosecutors against Mr. Ghosn that he conspired with Greg Kelly, a former Nissan director, to conceal a retirement payout that was never completed. Regulators said the scheme had unfolded over a roughly nine-year period, ending only with the cases against them. Nissan itself was indicted on related charges. The S.E.C. found that Mr. Ghosn, Mr. Kelly and others at Nissan had concealed more than $90 million in future payouts to Mr. Ghosn and had taken steps to increase his retirement compensation by more than $50 million. “Simply put, Nissan’s disclosures about Ghosn’s compensation were false,” said Steven Peikin, the S.E.C. co-director of enforcement. “Through these disclosures, Nissan advanced Ghosn and Kelly’s deceptions and misled investors.” Nissan, Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly — who agreed to pay a $100,000 fine — neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement. In a statement, Nissan said it was “firmly committed to continuing to further cultivate robust corporate governance.” Mr. Ghosn’s legal team said the settlement with the S.E.C. would enable them and their client to focus on the criminal trial in Japan, which is expected to begin in April. In a statement, the lawyers said Mr. Ghosn “will be acquitted of all charges and fully vindicated.” Lawyers for Mr. Kelly issued a statement saying he continues to deny the charges filed against him in Japan and calling the case in that country an “unfair prosecution.” Nissan finds itself in the midst of its deepest crisis in two decades, just as the car industry faces costly new challenges. In the last year, the company has weathered scandal after scandal, starting with the arrest of Mr. Ghosn and culminating this month in the sudden resignation its chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, after he admitted to receiving unearned compensation. As the company searches for new leadership, it faces a dire financial situation: It is cutting 12,500 jobs, and its profits have all but evaporated amid sluggish demand in Europe and its largest market, the United States, where a stale product lineup has failed to draw customer interest. And the costs of Mr. Ghosn’s ouster have continued to mount: The company faces a potentially costly securities suit in the United States, as well as the possibility in Japan of fines and future legal action related to the case. Nissan completed a nearly yearlong investigation into Mr. Ghosn this month. In a summary of the findings that was released to the public, the company claimed that his and Mr. Kelly’s actions had “resulted in violation of Nissan’s obligation to disclose compensation received by directors in the company’s annual securities reports.” It also said Mr. Ghosn had misused company assets for his personal benefit. In May, Nissan filed amendments to its financial filings from 2005 through 2017 to reflect what it now says was the total amount of compensation paid or promised to Mr. Ghosn during his tenure. The company has said the problems resulted from too much power being in Mr. Ghosn’s hands. But it has also said the board did not effectively carry out its oversight responsibilities, a failure that was enabled by a lack of effective corporate governance mechanisms. In June, shareholders approved a new board structure that increases the number of independent directors and adds committees responsible for overseeing audits, nominations and compensation, a structure based on international best practices and intended to provide adequate oversight."
40,Dozens of Civilians Reported Killed in Afghan Commando Strike,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 03:38:19 +0000",David Zucchino and Taimoor Shah,"Officials said that as many as 40 people, including children, may have died during a raid on an insurgent stronghold in the southern province of Helmand.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-deaths-army-airstrike.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Government officials in southern Afghanistan said on Monday that as many as 40 civilians, including children, may have been killed during an American-supported Afghan military raid on an insurgent stronghold the night before. Accounts from the scene, in Helmand Province, were fragmentary and contradictory, typical of violent clashes in which civilians are reported killed in remote areas late at night. Scores of civilians have died in recent weeks in Taliban suicide attacks in civilian areas and in American and Afghan airstrikes targeting insurgents. A defense official in Washington conceded that civilians had probably been killed Sunday night, possibly by secondary explosions from an insurgent weapons depot attacked by American warplanes. The fighting on Sunday took place in an area controlled by the Taliban, making it difficult to reach witnesses. Violence has surged in Afghanistan since months of peace negotiations between the United States and the Taliban were aborted on Sept. 7, just after the American envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said an agreement “in principle” had been reached. Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the Helmand governor, said an undetermined number of civilians were killed after an explosion at the weapons depot, which had been targeted by government forces late Sunday. But Haji Attaullah Afghan, head of the provincial council in Helmand, said a two-vehicle wedding convoy was fired upon by military helicopters, and that civilians were killed in both vehicles. The Afghan Defense Ministry confirmed a commando operation Sunday night that officials said killed 22 Taliban fighters from Pakistan and Bangladesh and captured 14 others in Musa Qala district, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand. Among those killed were the Taliban’s explosives chief for Helmand and two of his deputies, Afghanistan’s National Security Council said. In a statement, the Defense Ministry said officials would investigate reports of civilian casualties and “share the findings with media and the people.” The Afghan National Army’s 215th Maiwand Corps in Helmand said that Afghan forces had attacked a joint Taliban-Al Qaeda compound and captured five Al Qaeda members. In a statement, the corps said that an insurgent suicide bomber had killed two women, and that a third woman had died when the weapons depot exploded. The statement said government forces ordered the militants to surrender, but they responded by opening fire. It accused the Taliban and Al Qaeda of using civilians as shields. The Helmand governor’s office said that four top Taliban commanders and the Taliban shadow governor of Musa Qala were killed. Intelligence reports led the commandos to a compound that held weapons and suicide vests, the governor said in a statement. The United States military issued a statement on Monday confirming its role in the operation and the presence of foreign fighters. “U.S. forces partnered with Afghan security forces in an operation against Al Qaeda terrorists in Musa Qala in Helmand last night,” the military said, adding that “several foreigners associated with Al Qaeda were detained, including multiple persons from Pakistan and one from Bangladesh.” It said that American forces had conducted “precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and U.S. forces,” and that most of those killed were believed to have “died from Al Qaeda weapons” or insurgents’ suicide vests and other explosives. “The incident is under investigation with our Afghan partners,” the military said. In a separate incident Monday, three coalition service members were wounded when a member of the Afghan Civil Order Police opened fire on their convoy in Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan, an American military spokesman said. The spokesman, Col. Sonny Leggett, said troops in the convoy returned fire and killed the police officer, and that the incident was under review. A defense official in Washington said the three wounded soldiers were Americans. Abdul Motalib, a villager in Helmand, said on Monday that he was traveling in a two-vehicle wedding party convoy in Musa Qala the night before when military helicopters opened fire. He said the party was on its way to the bride’s home. The attack killed 15 women and children in one vehicle and five men in another just after the vehicles had stopped and turned on their flashers as the helicopters dropped flares, Mr. Motalib said. “First they targeted the vehicle carrying women and children, then the vehicle with the men,” he said. He survived because he had exited one of the stopped vehicles to seek cover in a corn field, he said. Mr. Afghan, the provincial council leader, said up to 40 civilians died in the vehicle attacks and in a separate incident nearby. He said 12 civilians were wounded. “This is inhumane, whoever carried out this airstrike,” Mr. Afghan said. He said the wedding party vehicles were fired upon even though they had shown security forces that they were civilians. On Sept. 19, as many as 30 civilians were reported killed in an American drone strike in eastern Afghanistan that an American military spokesman said had targeted Islamic State insurgents. The spokesman said the military was working with local officials to determine what had happened during the strike, in which local officials said civilian victims had been gathering pine nuts. The same day, a Taliban suicide bombing leveled a hospital in Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan, killing at least 39 civilians, most of them patients and relatives crushed or burned to death inside the hospital. A United Nations report released on June 30 said that 717 civilian deaths were attributed to American and Afghan government forces during the first six months of the year. That total exceeded the 531 civilian deaths attributed to the Taliban and other antigovernment extremists — though the total number of deaths and injuries attributed to extremists exceeded those attributed to pro-government forces. The report noted that many extremist attacks deliberately targeted civilians. American and Afghan airstrikes killed 363 civilians and wounded 156 between January and the end of June, the report said. Through Aug. 31, American warplanes launched 4,483 bombs and other munitions in Afghanistan this year, just over 100 more than during the same period a year earlier. Also Monday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in Beijing that officials had met a delegation of Taliban envoys to discuss the peace talks. A spokesman, Geng Shuang, called on the United States and the Taliban to continue negotiations and said that China was prepared to play a constructive role. Mr. Geng provided few details, and it was not clear what role Chinese officials could play, given the tensions already complicating relations with the United States."
41,Europe Tries to Seize Momentum for a New Deal on Migration,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 04:11:55 +0000",Jason Horowitz,"With a populist leader ousted in Italy, many see the chance to reach an agreement on distributing arrivals around the Continent, suffocating far-right arguments.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/europe/migration-crisis.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"ROME — At the height of the migration crisis, Italy called on the European Union to keep its promise and help shoulder the burden of the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers landing on the Continent’s southern Mediterranean border. Instead, Italy felt the bloc’s cold shoulder, and the ensuing popular frustration helped fuel the rise of the anti-immigrant nationalist Matteo Salvini, who virtually sealed ports to ships carrying rescued migrants before his political overreach led to his unexpected exit as interior minister this summer. With Mr. Salvini gone, centrist European leaders see a chance to apply the lessons of the past and give fresh momentum to efforts to overhaul the bloc’s immigration system. On Monday, interior ministers from France, Germany, Italy, Malta and Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Council, struck a temporary deal to redistribute migrants on aid ships to some member states immediately following their rescue. “Italy is no longer alone,” Italy’s new interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, told reporters on Monday afternoon. The agreement in Malta could be expanded to more countries when it is presented on Oct. 8 to interior ministers from all European Union countries. “They see a window of opportunity in Italy, because there’s a government that isn’t screaming about migrants and they don’t know how long this government will last,” said Anna Triandafyllidou, a professor of immigration policies at Ryerson University in Toronto. “It’s very important that Salvini is out,” she added. The Malta meeting essentially sought a formal workaround to existing European Union treaties, which put heavy burdens on front-line countries like Greece, Italy and Malta by requiring that asylum seekers stay where they arrive. In part for that reason, Mr. Salvini introduced a tough security decree, still in place, imposing steep fines, arrests and confiscations on aid vessels that enter Italy without permission. Italy hopes the new agreement will avoid the case-by-case negotiations which have followed standoffs between Italy and aid ships that have left the migrants they carry stranded precariously at sea for days or weeks. In the days before the meeting, Italy advocated that migrants should no longer automatically disembark at the nearest safe port — almost always Greece, Italy or Malta — but that a rotation of European Union member states open their ports as well. The sorting would be carried out on the ships that would bring them to a designated port in Italy. The interior ministers agreed to that principle in Malta on Monday. “I deeply believe the response to the subject of immigration is not in looking inward or in nationalist provocations but in building effective European solutions,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a meeting with the new Italian government in Rome last week. Italy is particularly eager to seize the momentum. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who as leader of the previous government had signed off Mr. Salvini’s hard-line legislation and tolerated his invective, has sought to reposition himself, and Italy, back in the European fold. The new Italian government, a tentative alliance between the center-left Democratic Party and the populist Five Star Movement, has quickly proved itself more pro-Europe — and more acceptable to Brussels — than the former government of Five Star and Mr. Salvini’s hard-right League party. After Monday’s meeting, Mr. Conte hailed the agreement as a positive step and sought to assure Italians that it would in no way draw more migrants into the Mediterranean, as critics of the deal have argued. In meeting with Mr. Macron last week, Mr. Conte said the two leaders had discussed “an efficient system to disembark, redistribute, and repatriate migrants.” Then, in a not-so-veiled criticism of Mr. Salvini, he added, “We must make sure the issue of migration isn’t left to those that use it as a permanent topic for their propaganda.” Mr. Conte has also called for “serious penalties” against member states that refuse to take part in the burden sharing. But in seeking to take the migration issue off the populist table, some critics say the deal will merely provide nationalist leaders in Hungary and Poland, as well as far-right opposition parties in France and Germany, with more of an opportunity to stir more outrage over what they depict as migrant invasions. Minutes after the deal was announced Monday, Mr. Salvini released a statement saying that while it was right to welcome “the few who really flee war, opening the Italian ports to everyone in the world is madness.” The deal to spread migrants around the Continent would only stoke resentment, said Francesco Borgonovo, a journalist at the right-wing Italian publication La Verità. This week, La Verità will release an anti-migration comic book by Mr. Borgonovo, the cover of which features an African man holding a knife dripping blood. Subtitled, “An Immigration Story,” it tells the tale of the son of a voodoo priestess who becomes a child soldier before migrating to Italy, where he brutally murders his do-gooder patron and a priest. Mr. Borgonovo said that Mr. Salvini had introduced realism into the European debate about migration by forcing the issue with his port closures. Even if he was absent, Mr. Salvini was clearly driving the European agenda and would loom over the Malta meeting, Mr. Borgonovo added. “He’s the nationalist elephant in the room,” he said. Mr. Salvini and his supporters are already arguing that with the hard-right populist out of power, migration is picking up. According to data from the interior ministry, September was the first month this year during which the number of migrants surpassed the number of arrivals compared with the same month in the previous year. And that is with several aid ships still impounded under Mr. Salvini’s tough security law. La Repubblica, a left-leaning daily in Italy, reported more than 300 recent “ghost landings” — occasions in which migrants reach the country’s ports on their own — in less than a week. In the Aegean Sea, the increase is even sharper. In August, Greece registered its busiest month of migrant arrivals in more than three years. The European Union has also sought to keep migrants from coming to the Continent by striking deals with Libyan tribal leaders and by setting up much-criticized processing centers in Niger and most recently, in Rwanda. Politicians across the political spectrum argue that the ultimate answer to the issue of migration lies in development in Africa. But their ideological differences break into the open when the migrants arrive on European shores. Momentum for a potential deal got a lift this month when the Ocean Viking, an aid ship operated in the Mediterranean Sea by Doctors Without Borders, rescued 82 migrants. After six days at sea waiting for a safe port, France and Germany volunteered to take a share of the migrants, which prompted Italy to allow the ship to disembark on the island of Lampedusa. Italy kept 24 migrants, France and Germany took in 24 each, and others went to Luxembourg and Portugal. The Ocean Viking then rescued 182 more migrants and Italy again granted them a safe port, this time in Messina, Sicily."
42,"School Collapses in Kenya, Killing at Least 7 Students","Mon, 23 Sep 2019 22:10:32 +0000",Carlos Mureithi,"The wooden structure at Precious Talent Top School crumbled as the school day began on Monday, officials said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/africa/kenya-school-collapse.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"NAIROBI, Kenya — At least seven students were killed and dozens more injured in Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday when the school building they were in collapsed, a government official said. The two-story wooden structure at Precious Talent Top School, a private school in western Nairobi, gave way around 7:30 a.m., shortly after classes began, said a government spokesman, Cyrus Oguna. The country’s education minister said that the second level of the school had been added on without planning permission. Images and video of the scene posted on social media and aired on local television showed rescue teams and bystanders clearing wooden beams, chunks of cement and corrugated metal sheeting. They shuffled through papers and chairs as a crowd gathered around the debris where the school had once stood. Kenyatta National Hospital said on Twitter that 64 students were being treated at the medical facility for “various soft tissue injuries.” The hospital added that the medical team “has managed to contain the situation and the children are stable as they receive treatment.” The cause of the collapse has not yet been determined, though commentators in local news outlets were quick to raise questions about the structural integrity of the building. George Magoha, the education minister, said that the building was originally a single-level structure and the owners of the school had added the second level without approval. He added that if a request for constructing the higher floor had been submitted, it would not have been approved. “If there was no other story put on top of that building, these innocent children would not have died,” he said during an afternoon briefing. The other buildings at the primary school, which around 800 students attend, will be inspected and evaluated before anyone returns, Mr. Magoha said. Such an inspection could take several days. William Ruto, the deputy president of Kenya, offered his condolences to the families of the victims, and noted in a Twitter post that “agencies have been mobilised to address the situation.” “We must create safe spaces for our children to learn,” he added. Several other buildings in Nairobi have collapsed in recent years, often because of shoddy construction. Three people died in a building collapse in Nairobi last year, and 51 were killed when a building gave way in 2016. In 2017, following the collapse of a seven-story residential building, Evans Kidero, who was then the governor of Nairobi, said at least 30,000 to 40,000 buildings in the city had been built without approval and were at risk of failure."
43,Iran Says British Tanker Is Free to Go After 2 Months of Detention,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 04:16:46 +0000",Richard Pérez-Peña and Daniel Victor,"Tehran had accused the tanker, the Stena Impero, of violating maritime rules, but the seizure was seen as retaliation for the holding of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/middleeast/iran-british-tanker-release.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"A British-flagged tanker that Iran seized in July is now free to leave, Tehran said on Monday, more than a month after the British authorities released an Iranian tanker that had been detained off Gibraltar. The news offered a rare sign of comity at a time when Iran has been in an escalating cycle of confrontation with its Persian Gulf neighbors and with the United States, including the shooting down of drones, the seizure of tankers and, most recently, an attack on major oil installations in Saudi Arabia. Officials of the United States and Saudi Arabia, Iran’s chief rival in the region, have blamed Tehran for the Sept. 14 attack on oil centers in the kingdom, raising the prospect of retaliatory strikes and even war. But so far, the only apparent action they have taken against Tehran is a tightening of economic sanctions. Iran had accused the British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, of violating maritime regulations in the Strait of Hormuz, but the seizure on July 19 was widely seen as retaliation for the detention of the Iranian vessel. The legal proceedings against the Stena Impero have concluded, and Iran has decided to waive the allegations of violations, an Iranian government spokesman, Ali Rabiyee, said at a news conference, according to Iranian and Western news agencies that were present. The ship had not left Bandar Abbas, a port in southern Iran, as of midday, and it was not clear how quickly it would set sail. Erik Hanell, chief executive of the tanker’s owner, the shipping company Stena Bulk, told SVT, a Swedish television station, that he hoped it would be a matter of hours. Iran detained the 23-member crew along with the ship. It released seven of them this month, but the others have remained with the vessel. The decision to release the ship comes a little more than a week after the attack on the Saudi oil installations. Iran has denied any responsibility for the attack, a sophisticated operation involving some two dozen drones and cruise missiles. The aerial strikes damaged infrastructure and temporarily cut Saudi oil production in half, sending tremors through world markets, but they caused no reported casualties. The Houthi rebel faction in Yemen’s civil war, a group that is known to use weapons supplied by Iran, has said it carried out the attack against Saudi Arabia, which has been bombing in Yemen for more than four years, killing thousands of people. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said early on Monday that there was “a very high degree of probability” that Iran was responsible for the strikes in Saudi Arabia, and he did not rule out British participation in military retaliation. The topic is sure to be aired this week at the United Nations General Assembly’s annual gathering of heads of government, which will be attended by Mr. Johnson, President Trump and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, among many others. In May and June, several tankers operating near the Strait of Hormuz were damaged in what the United States said was sabotage by Iranian forces — which Iran also denied. Iran also detained several ships for varying periods of time, notably the Stena Impero, and shot down an American surveillance drone. Analysts have characterized the attacks — whether carried out by Iran or by one of the armed factions it supports in the Middle East — and ship seizures as Tehran’s demonstration that it has the power to cut off a large part of the world’s energy supplies. Iran wants relief from punishing sanctions imposed by President Trump since he withdrew the United States from a 2015 deal that restricted the Middle Eastern country’s nuclear program. Relations have grown worse since then, as the United States has steadily added more economic penalties, seeking to choke off Iran’s oil sales, the life blood of its economy. In recent months, Iran has taken a series of steps to go beyond the limits imposed by the nuclear accord. While many other nations, including key American allies, have sided with Iran on the nuclear deal and the sanctions, there is less sympathy for Iran internationally than there was before the recent provocations. The direct confrontation with Britain began on July 4, when British marines and Gibraltar port officials seized an Iranian tanker, Grace 1, which has since been renamed the Adrian Darya 1. They said the ship was carrying oil to Syria, in violation of a European Union embargo. Iran denied the allegation and accused the British of concocting the story to act against Tehran at the behest of Washington, though Britain formally opposes the American sanctions. The government of Gibraltar, a semiautonomous British territory, released the ship six weeks later, and said that it had assurances that the Iranian tanker would not go to Syria. American officials asked that the ship be turned over to them, but the Gibraltar government rejected the request."
44,"Thomas Cook Travel Company Collapses, Stranding Thousands","Mon, 23 Sep 2019 21:49:55 +0000",Ceylan Yeginsu and Michael Wolgelenter,The collapse set in motion what was being described as the biggest peacetime repatriation in British history and had tourism officials in top vacation spots biting their nails.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/travel/thomas-cook-airline-collapse.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"LONDON — Hundreds of thousands of vacationers were left stranded when one of the world’s oldest tour companies, Thomas Cook, abruptly announced Monday, with some of its flights still in the air, that it was going out of business. Amid scenes of confusion at European airports, British officials scrambled to bring home 150,000 travelers, chartering dozens of jets to bring people home from as far away as Malaysia. It was described as the largest peacetime repatriation effort in the country’s history. The tour company, said that all its bookings, including flights operated directly by the agency, had been canceled. “We are sorry to announce that Thomas Cook has ceased trading with immediate effect,” it said. With that, travel plans for hundreds of thousands were snarled, and tourism officials in vacation hot spots braced for a potentially devastating hit to their economies. Thomas Cook was no ordinary travel company. Founded in 1841, it changed the face of British travel. Its ubiquitous storefronts specialized in low-cost package holidays that put beach vacations in exotic locales within the budgets of middle-income Britons. So its demise felt a bit like the end of an era — and it seemed in keeping with the larger mood in Britain as the country moves closer to a withdrawal from the European Union. Indeed, though the company’s brick-and-mortar business model was overtaken by time, some also saw in its travails early signs of Brexit damage to come. They said a weakened pound and uncertainty among would-be travelers had played a role in the collapse. [“Don’t just book it, Thomas Cook it.” Read about how it all went wrong for a travel giant.] Many of the travelers affected on Monday were already abroad, and wondering how they would get home. Others found their vacation plans dashed. Among them were Layton Roche and Natalie Wells, who booked flights more than a year ago from Manchester, England, to Kos, a Greek island, for their wedding this Friday. “I have been awake for 28 hours now,” Mr. Roche, a 30-year-old civil engineer, said in a message on Monday, as he and Ms. Wells, 31, were on their way to Birmingham to seek an alternative flight. The Britons stranded on holidays were among as many as 600,000 vacationers left high and dry worldwide. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement that it had arranged 60 flights to get people home on Monday, and that the effort would extend until Oct. 6. It was unclear whether citizens of other countries could expect similar help. “We will try our level best to get them home,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson. “There will be plans ready to deal with that if it is necessary.” If Thomas Cook’s customers were surprised, British officials had less reason to be. The government had refused to mount a financial rescue of the battered company; doing so, Mr. Johnson said, would create a “moral hazard” by encouraging other troubled companies to take undue risks. It was unclear, however, what steps, if any, the government took to prepare for the possibility of hordes of stranded travelers. Tremors from the collapse radiated across the world, to Malaysia and San Francisco, but were felt most acutely in Europe. In Greece, where 50,000 vacationers were expected to be repatriated to their home countries in the coming days, and in Spain, there were fears about the effects on their critical tourist industries. In Crete, alone, the tour company brought 400,000 visitors this year. Michalis Vlatakis, the head of the Greek island’s union of tour operators, described its collapse as a “7-magnitude earthquake.” Things were at least as dire in Spain, particularly in the Canary Islands and the Balearic archipelago. Together, they accounted for about 3.2 million of the 3.6 million passengers flying each year to Spain on planes owned or chartered by Thomas Cook, according to the Spanish National Airport Authority. Beyond the chaos and disappointment for travelers, the company’s collapse put 21,000 jobs at risk. The 178-year-old travel company had been in poor financial health for some time. It announced its closing after negotiations to obtain £200 million pounds, or $250 million, in emergency financing fell apart over the weekend. Analysts said Thomas Cook, struggling with a debt pile approaching 2 billion pounds — nearly $2.5 billion — had failed to adjust to the changing times. While other travel companies went totally online, for instance, Thomas Cook held onto its extensive chain of storefronts. “What everybody is not lending their thoughts to is that this has been a thoroughly badly run company,” David Buik, a financial analyst, said in an interview with LBC radio on Monday. “It has had far too many shops. The emphasis of the business has gone online.” But the company also suffered from a number of factors beyond its control, particularly Brexit, the planned British withdrawal from the European Union, which has cut the value of the pound. That has discouraged travel and squeezed profits. “If the majority of your business is in destinations which are in euros and you are against the backdrop where there is a lot of capacity and you cannot raise prices, then there is a cost squeeze,” Chris Tarry, an independent airline analyst, told the BBC. Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive of Thomas Cook, said, “There is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many U.K. customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer.” Mr. Fankhauser also cited a prolonged heat wave in the summer of 2018 that brought high prices in the Canary Islands, a popular destination for the tour operator. Terrorism and political unrest in North Africa, Turkey and Egypt have also hit the operator particularly hard in recent years, analysts said. Although as many as 600,000 Thomas Cook customers were traveling when it announced that it was closing its doors, it was unclear how many were actually stranded. Some of the company’s local partners said they were still operating. Condor, a German subsidiary airline of Thomas Cook, for example, was requesting a bridge loan from the German government and insisted that it would continue to serve the 240,000 of its customers — not all of them vacationers — currently out of the country. Because Thomas Cook customers are covered under a government insurance program, they are assured of refunds for canceled trips and repatriation free of charge. Those who bought only flights from Thomas Cook do not have the same protections and may need to rely more on personal travel insurance, if they have it. The government insurance program also reimburses hotels for the cost of the customers’ stay, even if cut short. Some resorts, however, appear not to have gotten the message. On Saturday, some British tourists described being stopped from checking out of their hotel in Tunisia over concerns the hotel might not be paid. They said they were essentially locked in until the matter was sorted out. Others were threatened with being kicked out, according to news reports. While the government may be covering the cost of canceled vacations, it is not helping out with the cost of making alternative arrangements. Mr. Roche and Ms. Wells, the couple planning to marry, had to pay an extra 4,000 pounds, or about $5,000, for alternative flights for themselves and some family members. And they were expecting to spend another £2,000, or $2,500, for their accommodations. “I’m absolutely gutted,” Mr. Roche said. Most of the couple’s guests, he said, could no longer attend the wedding because of the extra costs. The failure of Thomas Cook touched off a debate in Britain over whether the government should have intervened to prevent the collapse. Speaking to the British television network ITV, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said that beyond the fact that “governments don’t usually go around investing in travel companies,” a bailout of Thomas Cook would most likely have only put off the inevitable by “stretching things out for a couple of weeks.” “The company were asking for up to £250 million,” he said on “Good Morning Britain,” a news program. “They needed about £900 million on top of that, and they’ve got debts of £1.7 billion, so the idea of just spending taxpayers’ money on that just wasn’t really a goer.” Mr. Buik, the financial analyst, agreed that the government was right not to step in, saying that the company had been “hanging on rags.” Thomas Cook’s problems may prove a boon to other tour operators, particularly rival TUI, whose shares surged more than 8 percent in Monday trading. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said in a statement that the government intended to convene a task force to support the thousands of Thomas Cook employees who will lose their jobs. “This will be a hugely worrying time for employees of Thomas Cook, as well as their customers,” Ms. Leadsom said. “Government will do all it can to support them.”"
45,One Brother Stabbed the Other. The Journalist Who Wrote About It Paid a Price.,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:16:57 +0000",Adam Satariano and Emma Bubola,"The use of Europe’s “right to be forgotten” privacy law has broadened, illustrated by two Italian brothers, a stabbing and the journalist who wrote about them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/technology/right-to-be-forgotten-law-europe.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"PESCARA, Italy — Alessandro Biancardi, a journalist in the Italian coastal city of Pescara, knew he had a hot story for his small news website. Two brothers in their 70s had argued at a seaside restaurant, the police told him, and one had stabbed the other with a fish knife. Mr. Biancardi tapped out details of the brawl. The midafternoon fracas had started over money, he wrote, leading to nonfatal injuries and the arrests of the brothers and other family members. Then he pressed publish. That was March 2008. What Mr. Biancardi could not have known was that a decade later, the stabbing story would leave him unemployed and put him at the center of a debate over the internet’s future and the growing reach of Europe’s “right to be forgotten” privacy rule. Two and a half years after the stabbing story was published, one of the brothers demanded that it be deleted online because it damaged his reputation. Mr. Biancardi refused, citing the public’s right to know. That set in motion a legal drama that foreshadows future battles over how speech and privacy on the internet should be regulated, and by whom.  “Nobody will ever convince me that a law forcing you to delete truthful news can exist,” said Mr. Biancardi, 47, seated in the living room of his Pescara apartment this month.  A cornerstone of European privacy regulations, the right to be forgotten lets citizens request that a company or website take down material considered old, irrelevant, inaccurate or excessive. The concept dates to at least the 1990s and countries apply it differently, but it gained prominence when the European Union’s top court said in 2014 that it could be used to force Google to delist material from its search engine results.  Last year, the European Union adopted a tough new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which strengthened the right to be forgotten. This week, the European Court of Justice is scheduled to decide on two cases that could further expand how it can be applied. News organizations have long been granted an exemption from privacy policies like the right to be forgotten, to preserve a free press. But policy experts said Mr. Biancardi’s loss in Italian courts was a significant curtailment of that journalistic exception and suggested that news can now have an expiration date.  “There has been real mission creep with the right to be forgotten,” said Daphne Keller, a lawyer at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society. “First it was supposed to be about information found using search engines, but now we see it affecting news reporting.”  Governments around the world are scrutinizing those repercussions as they weigh more regulation of the internet.  In the United States, lawmakers are considering a national privacy law to regulate the collection and handling of user data. Next year, a new privacy law takes effect in California that includes a “right to erasure” for people to delete personal data. Brazil, Canada, Chile, India and Mexico are among those considering similar steps. Many governments have looked to Europe’s privacy laws, including the right to be forgotten, as a model. In one of the cases before the European court this week, Google could be required to scrub search results for users outside the European Union for the first time. The other case could make it easier for people to require Google and others to delete links to websites with certain personal information, such as health and religion. Privacy supporters praise the right to be forgotten as an important tool that protects people online. Some argue that Mr. Biancardi’s experience was atypical.  Google has been the most frequent target of the policy. Since 2014, Google said, it has received more than 3.3 million requests in Europe to delete links from search results, including those pointing to news, criminal convictions and social media posts. According to company figures, it has accepted 45 percent of the requests while rejecting or fighting the others. Peter Fleischer, Google’s senior privacy counsel, said the company has “worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe and to strike a sensible balance between two important, fundamental rights — people’s right of access to information in the public interest and privacy.” In Pescara, which sits on the Adriatic Sea on Italy’s eastern coast, Mr. Biancardi, and his wife, Alessandra Lotti, 39, have become intimately familiar with the right to be forgotten, which they call diritto all’oblio. The couple started their website, PrimaDaNoi, in 2005 after falling in love while writing for another Italian news website. PrimaDaNoi published stories on local arrests, court cases, government actions and corruption. At its peak, in 2010 and 2011, it drew more than 2 million page views a month. Mr. Biancardi and Ms. Lotti each earned about 1,000 euros a month, or about $1,100, from advertising on the site.  “In the morning of our wedding day, October 29, 2011, we worked,” said Ms. Lotti, who got into journalism to cover sports. “My mom was really upset.” Mr. Biancardi and Ms. Lotti often faced threats for what they published. On their honeymoon in New York, they were served with defamation lawsuits from an aggrieved subject of an article who sought 3 million euros in damages, or about $3.32 million. The suits were eventually dismissed.  “My only duty is to write and verify information,” Mr. Biancardi said from the apartment where he and Ms. Lotti worked 12-hour days at side-by-side desks. “Everything else comes after.” In 2011, PrimaDaNoi became Italy’s first news website ordered by the courts to delete an article under the concept of the right to be forgotten. That story featured a couple accused of attempted extortion; the charges were later dropped and they asked for the article to be expunged.  Mr. Biancardi wrote about how the court had ruled against him. That drew attention from others who asked for articles about themselves to be taken down.  One of those demands was from Vittorio Pecoraro, now in his 80s, who was stabbed by his brother, Umberto, in the 2008 seaside restaurant brawl. The brothers were arrested after the fight. Assault-related charges against Vittorio Pecoraro were effectively dropped when the authorities did not pursue them. Vittorio Pecoraro sued Mr. Biancardi, citing the right to be forgotten. Mr. Biancardi refused to remove the article. The story had been based on information from the police, he said. Nothing was factually wrong.  But Vittorio Pecoraro argued that his privacy had been violated. The article was easily available and searchable online, and he had not been convicted of a crime. Yet because of PrimaDaNoi, what he considered a humiliating family argument had become the first thing that many people knew about him and his pizza and seafood restaurant, he said. “I have a reputation, I have been here for 50 years, I am known all over,” Mr. Pecoraro said in an interview at the restaurant, Positano, where the 2008 fight had occurred.  His lawyer, Paolo Sardini, said Google was not targeted because the article was Mr. Biancardi’s responsibility. Umberto Pecoraro’s son, Vincenzo, said his father declined to comment.  In 2013, an Italian judge ruled in favor of Vittorio Pecoraro and ordered PrimaDaNoi to delete its stabbing story, saying the information in it was old and no longer in the public interest. (Mr. Pecoraro didn’t ask for another PrimaDaNoi article about the incident to be deleted because it didn’t rank high in Google’s search results for his restaurant.) Mr. Biancardi was ordered to pay 10,000 euros, or about $11,000, to Mr. Pecoraro for harming his reputation and business. When Mr. Biancardi said he could not afford that, Mr. Pecoraro was allowed to seize his scooter. Mr. Biancardi appealed the judge’s decision to Italy’s highest court. In 2016, the appeal was rejected.  For Mr. Biancardi, the 2016 decision was the tipping point. While he has appealed the verdict to the European Court of Human Rights, the case hasn’t been heard. Over the past decade, PrimaDaNoi had already received 240 legal demands related to privacy and the right to be forgotten, including 40 that ended up in court. The ruling against him confirmed the right to be forgotten had the upper hand, he said.  Mr. Biancardi said he tried to persuade people to target Google instead, but with little success. He said he was at least 50,000 euros in debt from legal fees and fines.  By last year, Mr. Biancardi stopped fighting the takedown requests. The cost wasn’t worth it, he decided, and he deleted almost every article that people demanded. He lost weight and wasn’t sleeping.  Last September, exactly 13 years after starting PrimaDaNoi, he shut down the site. Mr. Sardini, the lawyer for Mr. Pecoraro, said other websites did not fight takedown demands. “They were the only ones to insist,” he said.  Mr. Biancardi has returned to school to study digital marketing. But even with PrimaDaNoi’s closing, the legal fights continue. Several cases are ongoing about past stories and he is holding out hope the European Court of Human Rights will hear his final appeal to overturn the verdict on the stabbing story. Ms. Lotti, now working as a secretary, said the experience left her wondering what to teach their 4-year-old son about pursuing his dreams.  “It’s been a year, but I still don’t know if I will be able to tell him, ‘If you believe in something, believe in it until the end,’” she said. “Because our experience taught us a different lesson.”"
46,Trump’s Hold on Military Aid Blindsided Top Ukrainian Officials,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:55:36 +0000",Andrew E. Kramer,The withholding of aid is now at the center of questions about whether President Trump manipulated foreign policy to pressure the Ukrainian government to take action damaging to Joseph R. Biden Jr.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/world/europe/ukraine-trump-military-aid.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"KIEV, Ukraine — Senior Ukrainian officials said they were blindsided over the summer when they heard the United States would withhold security assistance to the country. “It was a total surprise,” said Pavlo A. Klimkin, who was Ukraine’s foreign minister in August when he learned of the Trump administration’s suspension of military aid by reading a news article. The blocking of military aid to Ukraine is now at the center of questions about whether President Trump manipulated foreign policy to pressure the Ukrainian government to take action that would hurt Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a top rival in the campaign for the presidency. President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he used a July 25 phone call with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to accuse Mr. Biden of corruption. Mr. Biden oversaw American policy toward Ukraine in the Obama administration when his son served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. Allies of Mr. Trump have pointed to a conflict of interest, and asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden’s request in 2016 that Ukraine’s president at the time, Petro O. Poroshenko, dismiss a prosecutor who had investigated the gas company. By the time of that July 25 call, the administration had already suspended the aid, a decision reached in early July, according to a former American official. But the news would not reach the Ukrainian officials until much later, and then through nonofficial channels. For years, Ukrainian officials had coordinated with the Pentagon, the State Department and members of Congress on military aid. Mr. Klimkin said he received no formal notice through American diplomatic channels of the halt in aid, although he noted the suspension came as the ministry was transitioning to a new administration. He left the ministry on Aug. 29. American military assistance for Ukraine had flowed unobstructed into the country since 2014, the year Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a war in two eastern provinces. The aid had always arrived in carefully choreographed shipments planned months in advance. If the United States harbored concerns about any misuse of the aid by Ukraine, the senior officials said they had never heard about them. Mr. Klimkin said American officials had always provided the aid along with encouragement to overhaul the army and military industries to root out corruption. But Mr. Klimkin said that aid was not conditional on those issues, and that he had heard no expressions of concern on those fronts from the United States in 2019. “I never heard a discussion about meeting these conditions,” he said. “I’m not aware of any indication that something could have gone wrong.” After a bipartisan outcry in Congress, the White House agreed to restore the aid in mid-September. If the decision to suspend the aid was tied to a request by Mr. Trump for a politically motivated investigation, that “represents a fundamental challenge and problem for Ukraine,” Mr. Klimkin said, possibly threatening what had been bipartisan support in Congress for military assistance to the country. “At the end of the day, the only ones who will be happy about that are the people sitting in the Kremlin,” he said. In an interview on Ukrainian television on Saturday, Ukraine’s current foreign minister, Vadym V. Prystaiko, said Mr. Trump had not pressured Mr. Zelensky in the telephone call. “There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist,” he said. “This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, including those requiring serious answers.” Another official who learned of the hold on aid like a bolt from the blue was Oleh Shevchuk, who was deputy minister of defense in charge of logistics and oversaw the aid shipments until this month. He also said he learned of it through media reports. Everything had been arriving smoothly, he said. Even as the news of the suspension came out, he said, Ukraine was receiving containers of medical supplies in Odessa, a Black Sea port. The Ukrainian military was expecting 33 Humvees equipped as ambulances, water purifying equipment and so-called containerized housing units, or mobile homes for soldiers. The Ukrainian military still expects these items, he said. In fact, the hold came and went so quickly he noticed no change in the shipments and American officials never informed him of any planned delays, Mr. Shevchuk said. “We got more this year than last year,” he said. The United States has provided about $1.5 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine since 2014, almost entirely as equipment, often drawn from United States Army surpluses, rather than money transfers to the Ukrainian budget. It includes items much sought-after on the battle front, like body armor, night-vision goggles and armored ambulances. But the aid has not been decisive in the now five-year-old war. Some aid, including ready-to-eat meals and at least one sophisticated counter-battery radar, has been captured and gleefully put on display by the Russian-backed separatists. As a major component of the aid, about 300 American soldiers serve as trainers at a military base in western Ukraine, far from the fighting in the east. Oksana Syroid, a former deputy speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, said in an interview that no American concerns about military aid crossed her desk this year before the hold was announced. “It’s a very slippery road, a very dangerous approach, to make external relations a hostage to internal politics,” she said of a possible tie of the aid to corruption accusations against Mr. Biden. “It’s like asking a neighbor to take sides in an argument with your spouse.”"

48,"China Scores Businesses, and Low Grades Could Be a Trade-War Weapon","Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:18:58 +0000",Alexandra Stevenson and Paul Mozur,"Beijing hopes its social credit system will quickly punish companies accused of wrongdoing. U.S. firms could get hit, too.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/business/china-social-credit-business.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"BEIJING — China is funneling vast amounts of public and private data into huge databases aimed at tightening its control over its nearly 1.4 billion people.  But the business world has become its biggest target.  Beijing is increasingly amassing information now divided among various government agencies and industry associations — including court decisions, payroll data, environmental records, copyright violations, even how many employees are members of the Communist Party — and using it to grade businesses and the people who run them, according to state media, government documents and experts.  Companies that get low grades can be banned from borrowing money or doing other essential tasks. Their owners or executives could have their bank accounts frozen or be forbidden from traveling.  It isn’t just aimed at Chinese businesses. In letters sent to the companies, officials have threatened to give United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines black marks on their records if they don’t bend to Beijing’s wishes. FedEx could face a similar punishment.  China calls it the social credit system. By next year, Chinese leaders had hoped to start an ambitious nationwide program focused on punishing or rewarding individuals. It was aimed at replicating the credit scoring system common in the United States and other places, as well as taming behavior in a country where laws are inconsistently enforced.  Civil libertarians warned that it would create a digital Big Brother that would intrude into everyday Chinese life. But the system has yet to materialize for individuals on a mass scale. For many businesses, however, social credit has become a fact of life. In September, China’s central economic planning agency announced that it had completed a first evaluation of 33 million businesses, giving them ratings from 1 for excellent to 4 for poor. China hopes it will someday become a nationwide regulatory tool, harnessing the country’s growing skills in big data and automation, to help the Communist Party keep the business world in line.  “It’s supposed to affect the decision making of businesses to conform to what the party wants,” said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. Loren Fei, the 30-year-old-daughter of a silk factory owner, has been added to a blacklist of businesses and their owners. Because her father couldn’t pay his bills, she said, her bank accounts have been frozen and she lost her job and her ability to travel. “My family really wants to pay back the money, and the system is making it impossible,” Ms. Fei said. The authorities are testing the system as a tool to bend foreign companies to the Communist Party’s political views.  United, Delta and American received letters last year from Chinese aviation officials saying their social credit score could be hit unless their websites labeled Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan as part of China. Lower scores would lead to investigations, the possibility of frozen bank accounts, limitations on local employees’ movement and other punishments, according to a letter sent to United and seen by The New York Times.  Representatives of United, Delta and American Airlines confirmed changing their websites but declined to comment specifically on the matter.  Social credit is one aspect of the Communist Party’s efforts under Xi Jinping, its top leader, to strengthen its hold over the country. The authorities are installing separate facial-recognition technology and other monitoring systems to quell dissent as well as stop crime. They have taken a tougher line on media and worked to give the party a greater role in offices and classrooms.  Applied to businesses, the social credit system could bring real benefits to China. Despite Beijing’s authoritarian grip on power, it has long struggled to get businesses to follow the law. Competing, inefficient government ministries hinder enforcement. Local governments shelter powerful businesses. The result has been widespread pollution, rampant violations of labor laws and other problems.  For instance, Ms. Fei said that for years her family’s silk factory had been given dispensation to break environmental rules by local government authorities eager for economic growth. It was finally shut down for environmental reasons. But companies have little recourse if the data is inaccurate or punishments disproportionately disruptive, experts say.  “The unified rewards and punishment system significantly increases the potential for one violation to snowball across your operations until you have this avalanche of penalties that make it impossible to operate until you solve that one thing,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of digital research at Trivium China, a consulting firm that recently published a report on social credit.  Foreign companies have expressed concern about how they could be affected by their business partners. The German chemical company BASF, for example, is responsible for ensuring that its Chinese partners stay environmentally compliant. “They put pressure on us in the supply chain to sort out the environmental challenges,” said Jörg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, who is also the chief representative of BASF in China. “That’s a definite shift that puts a lot of pressure on us.” Foreign businesses also worry that social credit could become a weapon in the trade war between China and the United States. In a report last month, the European Union Chamber of Commerce cited the example of FedEx, the American package carrier, which has been caught in the middle of the trade fight. The Chinese government has threatened to place FedEx on a list of foreign companies and people it considers unreliable, alleging that it broke the law by withholding the shipment of Huawei products. The language used was similar to social credit. Chinese officials have not released the list or said what it would do, but they have said they will treat all companies equally.  China began to detail its ambitions for the social credit system six years ago, saying it could be a reality by 2020. While some critics saw it as a form of total social control, it was primarily envisioned as a tool for a country where people often break the law in big and little ways without consequences. The Chinese authorities typically exert social control through the police, who are setting up separate, more draconian systems that include biometric data, like face scans and DNA records.  In any case, social credit has proved difficult to use on individuals. China’s central bank canceled plans to include data from the popular electronic payment systems run by Alibaba and Tencent, two Chinese internet giants. Pilot programs have been started in only a few places. Even there, the programs have had little impact. During a visit to Rongcheng, a social credit pilot city in eastern China, officials said that a good score would get you a speedier check-in at the hospital and easier access to loans. But hospital workers and teachers said social credit had not affected how they do their jobs. Many residents said they were unaware it existed. “I might have heard about it somewhere but I think it’s none of my business and not relevant to our lives in the village,” said Liang Xiaoli, a store owner. Besides, she added, “I don’t really care. I mean, why should I?” Residents were rewarded based on factors like whether they helped to keep the city clean. Officials with clipboards collected data and handed out self-assessment forms. They posted photos of citizens with top scores on bulletin boards. In many cases the standouts were related to local Communist Party leaders. Liang Huaying, a Rongcheng official, said they got points because they most often showed up at official events.  The system has proved more adaptable to ensuring good conduct for business.  The social credit system brings together various blacklists long run by different ministries and local governments, allowing the authorities to broadly and consistently punish wrongdoers. But while China is assembling a nationwide social credit system, it still has dozens of city-level systems that use different scoring methods.  Ms. Fei, the daughter of the silk factory owner, found out she was in the system during a work trip in late 2017, when she could not buy a train ticket home. Then her bank accounts were frozen. She was eventually fired from her job as a financial analyst. Ms. Fei had signed for a loan on her father’s behalf. Ms. Fei’s mother, who is retired, is also on the blacklist because she is a shareholder. Her monthly pension payments have been frozen. The family is in debt for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ms. Fei, who now sells goods on the internet, said she makes one-tenth of what she did before.  She found a community of people online with situations like hers. One man told her he used to be a civil servant until he was forced to quit his job after being blacklisted.  Ms. Fei said this was unfair. “No one wants to be a dishonest person,” she said.

Mr. Bolsonaro had accused Ms. Bachelet of “meddling” in Brazil’s affairs after she raised concerns about a jump in killings by the Rio de Janeiro police, backtracking on democratic norms and attacks on indigenous communities. He also took personal aim at Ms. Bachelet, who was formerly Chile’s president, saying the only reason her country didn’t turn into Cuba was “thanks to those who had the courage to put a stop to the left in 1973.” Mr. Bolsonaro was alluding to the socialist president, Salvador Allende, who was overthrown in a 1973 military coup, as well as to Ms. Bachelet’s father, an air force general who remained loyal to Mr. Allende, and who was imprisoned and tortured, dying in jail. In La Tercera, a Chilean newspaper, which provided extracts of Ms. Bachelet’s interview with Chilean national television scheduled to broadcast on Sunday evening, she was quoted as saying, “I was asked in a news conference about the situation in Brazil, and we gave the information that we have, which is the number of people who have been killed and the difficulty for civil society to continue doing the things they were doing before.” Asked specifically about Mr. Bolsonaro’s remarks, she alluded to Brazil’s own military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985, which Mr. Bolsonaro has praised as “glorious.” “How I take things depends on who is saying them,” Ms. Bachelet said. “So if someone is saying that their country has never been under dictatorship, that there has never been any torture there.” She continued, “Well then let him say that the death of my father by torture ensured that Chile did not become Cuba. The truth is that I feel sorry for Brazil.” Ms. Bachelet’s office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment."
50,Egypt Protests Came as a Total Shock. The Man Behind Them Is Just as Surprising.,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 12:41:35 +0000",Vivian Yee and Nada Rashwan,"The videos of a potty-mouthed millionaire, who cheerfully insults the president, spurred protests across Egypt. His influence came out of the blue; no one knows how far it can go or long it can last.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/world/middleeast/egypts-protests-sisi-mohamed-ali.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"CAIRO — Under the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, so little dissent is allowed — and what little there is comes at such a high price — that when just a few hundred people across the country called for Mr. el-Sisi’s ouster in a burst of scattered protests on Friday night, it came as a shock. The apparent trigger for the demonstrations was almost as unexpected: Mohamed Ali, a 45-year-old construction contractor and part-time actor who says he got rich building projects for the Egyptian military and then left for Spain to live in self-imposed exile, where he began posting videos on social media accusing Mr. el-Sisi of corruption and hypocrisy. In the three weeks since his first video appeared, Mr. Ali has reinvented himself as a whistle-blower, an el-Sisi antagonist and a protest guru, and his tales of corruption at the top have transformed him into a leading voice of opposition to the president. When the protests erupted, it was at the time and date Mr. Ali had urged from afar. But the extent, and durability, of Mr. Ali’s out-of-nowhere influence — and his ability to spur further demonstrations — remains to be seen. His surge from obscurity to prominence has also raised questions in Egypt about whether his sudden fame has been helped along or exploited by powerful interest groups in the country, inside or outside the government. “It is sort of odd,” said Amy Hawthorne, the deputy director for research at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “Who is this person, who is he connected to, what led him to come out with these allegations now? Obviously he’s very well connected, but who exactly are his connections?” To at least some protesters, Mr. Ali was less an inspiration than an opportunity to vent their frustrations. “I protested because the way Sisi is ruling is wrong and disgraceful,” said Ali Mohamed, 19, a resident of the working-class Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq who live-streamed some of the Tahrir Square demonstrations on Friday. “Egypt deserves better than for its land to be sold out or for its people to be imprisoned.” He added: “People were just waiting for the opportunity to protest — Mohamed Ali’s videos are not the real reason why they did. The reason is that people wanted to take action.” On Saturday evening, about 200 protesters in the Red Sea city of Suez were met with police officers firing rubber bullets, according to posts on social media and a witness. In Cairo, however, there did not appear to be any signs of further protests. The police pre-emptively flooded Tahrir Square on Saturday, where mass demonstrations during the Arab Spring eight years ago brought down President Hosni Mubarak and raised hopes for democratic change. The test of just how deep Mr. Ali’s influence is could come as soon as this week. In a video posted Saturday evening, Mr. Ali called for a new round of protests against Mr. el-Sisi to take place this coming Friday. “We should stop making gods out of presidents,” he said in the video, exhorting the military to remove Mr. el-Sisi from power. Though the police did not kill any protesters on Friday, the security forces have not hesitated to use deadly force in the past, and Mr. el-Sisi is likely to order a swift and thorough crackdown if the protests persist. Since coming to power in a 2013 military takeover, Mr. el-Sisi has cemented his hold through harsh repression that has silenced critics and curtailed free speech. An Egyptian monitoring group, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, said on Sunday that at least 274 people had been arrested at the protests, and that some demonstrators had reported being beaten and tear-gassed. Given the gravity of the possible consequences, observers were stunned that protesters had dared to show up at all, apparently moved by little more than a man with a webcam waging a campaign against Mr. el-Sisi from the safety of Spain. But the Facebook videos Mr. Ali posts under the name “Mohamed Ali Secrets” have become must-see TV among young, social media-savvy Egyptians, who tune in every day or two to watch him talk to the camera, chain-smoking as he cheerfully insults Mr. el-Sisi as a “midget” and a “disgrace.” There have been at least 35 so far. In working-class, colloquial and often profane Arabic, he muses on the military’s growing domination of the Egyptian economy. He complains of being owed millions of dollars by the government for construction work. He accuses Mr. el-Sisi of wasting government funds on vanity projects like multimillion-dollar presidential palaces. “The system has made us all corrupt,” he said in one video. “We are going to change that system and install a proper one.” Mr. Ali’s gravel-voiced exposés have resonated with many Egyptians, who have watched Mr. el-Sisi erect enormous building projects while their own finances collapse. The government reported in July that one in three Egyptians were living in poverty. The video monologues have been repeatedly taken down from Facebook, under unclear circumstances, but not before accumulating millions of views. On Twitter, Egyptians joked that his episodes were better than Netflix. Then last week, Mr. Ali called for viewers to take to the streets Friday evening after a soccer game between two popular Egyptian teams. That appeared to let loose hundreds of Egyptians — many of them young, working-class men — who participated in protests in a scattering of cities around the country, including in Tahrir Square and the poor neighborhood of Warraq Island in Cairo, as well as in Alexandria, Suez and El-Mahalla El-Kubra. But beyond the fact that the protests erupted when Mr. Ali called for them, theories far outweighed the available information about his precise role. Some observers speculated Mr. Ali may be a puppet controlled, at least in part, by another entity, possibly people in Mr. el-Sisi’s government who are seeking to undermine or even overthrow the president, who is out of the country attending the United Nations General Assembly this week. “The entire thing is a little bit fishy,” said Khaled Dawoud, a longtime journalist and spokesman for one of Egypt’s all-but-defunct opposition parties. “He didn’t introduce himself as a politician. He’s more like a whistle-blower, and suddenly he decided to turn into a revolutionary leader.” Others wondered whether the protests had truly been spontaneous, or if they had been orchestrated by opposition groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that Mr. el-Sisi has sought to throttle ever since he came to power in a coup that deposed President Mohamed Morsi, a member of the Brotherhood who was also Egypt’s first democratically elected leader. Mr. Dawoud said the opposition, which has lost much of its leadership to prison or self-imposed exile, was waiting to see how the protests evolved — and to identify who exactly was protesting — before jumping in. Those who support the president say the Brotherhood is likely to be quietly organizing the protests. Though public opinion is difficult to gauge accurately in Egypt, they say many Egyptians support Mr. el-Sisi’s economic overhauls and the stability he has brought in a time of turmoil across the region. “The trains go and run on time. We lacked that for two and a half years,” said Moataz Abdel Fattah, a pro-Sisi political scientist. “The great majority of Egyptians would say, ‘No, hold on, you cannot drive the country into some sort of waterfall.’” Most protesters on Friday appeared to be young men in their teens or early 20s, who were children during the upheavals of 2011 and 2013, when protests brought down two successive presidents. Good-looking and fit, Mr. Ali may be seen as something of a folk hero, analysts said — an uneducated man who made millions and who is now riding to the rescue of the working classes. He does not speak like a democracy activist or a politician, but like one of them — or, perhaps, who they would like to be. “He resonates with a wider sector of Egyptians in a way that no one before him ever did,” said Rabab el-Mahdi, a political scientist at the American University in Cairo. “They look at him and see a successful version of themselves.” It is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Ali exudes on-camera charisma. A movie in which he stars and also produced, about young Egyptians making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe, won the 2019 Outstanding Art for Peace prize at the Luxembourg Peace Prize awards in June. But Mr. Ali’s motivations remain murky, as do his exact whereabouts in Spain. In an article published in the Spanish edition of Vanity Fair in July, he said that he decided to settle in Barcelona and pursue business projects there after a vacation in the area. He could not be reached for comment. His credibility with Egyptians is, if anything, greater because he profited from the very system to which he is now taking a sledgehammer, and because he does not seem motivated by ideology. “He’s not a person from the opposition that seemed to have an ax to grind,” said Michele Dunne, the director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “He’s seen as a bit of a common man, not an elite figure speaking to them about abstract elite concepts.” Mr. el-Sisi may have helped legitimize Mr. Ali as an opposition figure with a recent speech in which he addressed but did not refute his claims. “Yes, I have built presidential palaces, and will build more,” he said. “I will continue to do more and more, but not for me. Nothing is in my name. It is in Egypt’s name.”"
51,Israel’s Arab Parties Back Benny Gantz to End Netanyahu’s Grip,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 21:39:17 +0000",David M. Halbfinger and Isabel Kershner,"Ayman Odeh, leader of the Arab Joint List, said his group would support a government by Mr. Gantz to keep Benjamin Netanyahu from getting a new term.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/world/middleeast/arab-list-israel-gantz-netanyahu.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"JERUSALEM — After 27 years of sitting out decisions on who should lead Israel, Arab lawmakers on Sunday recommended that Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief, get the first chance to form a government over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a watershed assertion of political power. Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Arab Joint List, wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed published on Sunday that the alliance’s 13 incoming lawmakers — the third-largest faction in the newly elected Parliament — had decided to recommend Mr. Gantz because it would “create the majority needed to prevent another term for Mr. Netanyahu.” “It should be the end of his political career,” Mr. Odeh wrote. The Arab lawmakers’ recommendation, which Mr. Odeh and other members of the Joint List delivered to President Reuven Rivlin in a face-to-face meeting Sunday evening, reflected Arab citizens’ impatience to integrate more fully into Israeli society and to have their concerns be given greater weight by Israeli lawmakers. “There is no doubt a historic aspect to what we are doing now,” Mr. Odeh said in the meeting with the president, which was broadcast live. Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party responded furiously to the Joint List’s recommendation, continuing an anti-Arab campaign as if the election was yet to take place. “There are now two options,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a video clip soon after the meeting between members of the Joint List and the president. “Either there will be a minority government that relies on those who reject Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glorify terrorists who murder our soldiers and civilians, or there will be a broad national government.” “I know what the answer is and so do you,” he continued, “which is why I will work as hard as I can to form a broad national unity government.” There was no immediate word from Mr. Gantz or his Blue and White party. The Joint List’s recommendation was a striking act of comeuppance for Mr. Netanyahu, who for years had rallied his right-wing supporters by inflaming anti-Arab sentiments. Before the Sept. 17 election, he accused Arab politicians of trying to steal the election and at one point accused them of wanting to “destroy us all.” Israeli Arabs “have chosen to reject Benjamin Netanyahu, his politics of fear and hate, and the inequality and division he advanced for the past decade,” Mr. Odeh wrote in the Op-Ed for The Times. It was all the more surprising that the Arab lawmakers chose to end a quarter-century of noninvolvement by endorsing Mr. Gantz, a former army chief of staff. He led a devastating, 50-day war against the militant groups in Gaza five years ago. Blue and White has three former military chiefs in its top four slots, who appeared in a past campaign video in full battle dress. In a further gesture of outreach to the Israeli mainstream, Mr. Odeh quoted from Psalms 118:22, telling Mr. Rivlin, in Hebrew, “The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone” — a verse cited in Jewish and Christian scriptures and liturgies. Still, even though the Joint List recommended that Mr. Gantz be asked first to form a government, Mr. Odeh wrote that the group would not itself enter a government led by Mr. Gantz because he had not agreed to embrace its entire “equality agenda.” That agenda consists of various positions, among them, changing housing and planning laws to treat Arab and Jewish neighborhoods the same; resuming peace talks with the Palestinians; and repealing the law passed last year that declared Israel the nation-state only of the Jewish people. Also, one of several predominantly Arab parties making up the Joint List, Balad, which accounts for three of the alliance’s 13 seats, opposed recommending Mr. Gantz. Its representatives did not attend the meeting with the president. Some Arab lawmakers described Mr. Gantz as a “default choice.” The last time Arab lawmakers recommended a prime minister was in 1992, when two Arab parties with a total of five seats in Parliament recommended Yitzhak Rabin — another former chief of staff — though they did not join his government. “We have decided to demonstrate that Arab Palestinian citizens can no longer be rejected or ignored,” Mr. Odeh wrote. In the 1992 election, Mr. Rabin initially held a narrow majority in the 120-seat Knesset even without the Arab parties’ support, though he came to rely on it a year later after Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party, quit the government when Mr. Rabin signed the Oslo peace accords. Mr. Odeh wrote that the decision to support Mr. Gantz was meant as “a clear message that the only future for this country is a shared future, and there is no shared future without the full and equal participation of Palestinian citizens.” Mr. Gantz narrowly edged the prime minister in the national election last Tuesday. Afterward, both candidates called for unity, but differed on how to achieve it. The former army chief appears to lack a 61-seat majority even with the Joint List’s support. He emerged from the election with 57 seats, including those of allies on the left and the Joint List, compared with 55 seats for Mr. Netanyahu and his right-wing allies. Some analysts questioned whether Balad’s three seats would ultimately be counted as being on Mr. Gantz’s side, since Balad refused to endorse him, potentially leaving Mr. Gantz with only 54 supporters. Avigdor Liberman, leader of the secular, right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, which won eight seats, is in position to be a kingmaker, but said on Sunday that he would not recommend any candidate. He said Mr. Odeh and the Joint List were not merely political opponents, but “the enemies” and belonged in the “Parliament in Ramallah,” not in the Knesset. Mr. Liberman said that Mr. Gantz called him on Sunday night, and that the pair agreed to meet on Monday. Mr. Rivlin began hearing the recommendations of each major party Sunday evening and was to finish on Monday, before entrusting the task of forming a government to whichever candidate he believes has the best chance of being successful. In remarks at the start of that process, Mr. Rivlin said the Israeli public wanted a unity government including both Blue and White and Likud. On paper, the Joint List’s recommendation increases the chances that Mr. Rivlin will give Mr. Gantz the first crack at forming a government. But analysts said the postelection imbroglio was far from resolved. In deciding who is better placed to form a viable and stable coalition, Mr. Rivlin may take more than the basic numbers of recommendations into consideration, according to experts. In addition to Balad’s non-endorsement, he could, for example, take into account the Joint List’s broader refusal to join a Gantz-led government in weighing Mr. Gantz’s prospects. In any case, there are risks for both Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu in being the first to try to form a government, and analysts were already parsing the pros and cons of going first. Each might prefer their rival to try first and fail, in the hope that the second time around, it may be easier to persuade potential partners to cooperate in order to prevent a third election. For Mr. Gantz, there could be an additional advantage in waiting: Mr. Netanyahu is facing a looming indictment in three corruption cases on accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, and he could be charged in the coming weeks or months."
52,Two 13-Year-Olds Are Arrested Over Hong Kong Protests,"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 13:36:22 +0000",Mike Ives and Elaine Yu,"One of the minors, a girl, was arrested on charges of burning a Chinese national flag. She was held overnight in police detention.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"HONG KONG — The Hong Kong police arrested two 13-year-olds on the fringes of antigovernment demonstrations over the weekend, including a girl accused of burning a Chinese national flag, the authorities said on Sunday. The arrests on Saturday appear to be further signals that the local police are taking an increasingly hard line against the pro-democracy demonstrators who have roiled the city for three and a half months. Protesters have taken to destroying symbols of Chinese state authority, including flags, in recent months, but the latest arrest comes less than two weeks before Oct. 1, the foremost political holiday in the Chinese calendar and one which Beijing takes pains to ensure is celebrated without incident. The arrests came amid another weekend of protests across the city, and vandalism at several subway stations and shopping malls. Protesters at a mall in northern Hong Kong stomped on and painted a Chinese flag, and heckled businesses that they perceived to be friendly to Beijing. The two minors were arrested on Saturday during a long day of street clashes in which protesters threw bricks and firebombs and the police fired multiple rounds of tear gas in Yuen Long, a satellite town near Hong Kong’s border with the Chinese mainland. The police said protesters had at one point on Saturday used “hard objects” to attack an officer who was conducting an arrest and attempted to steal his revolver. Television footage from Yuen Long also showed protesters assaulting at least two unarmed men. A group of masked protesters was seen burning a Chinese flag in broad daylight on Saturday during a police-approved march through the Tuen Mun district of northwestern Hong Kong, a few miles from Yuen Long. The police later said that a 13-year-old girl had been arrested that night on suspicion of “desecrating the national flag” in Tuen Mun. She was held in detention overnight and released on bail by Sunday afternoon. On Sunday, local television news stations broadcast protesters stomping on a Chinese flag and spraying it with black paint before dumping it in a river during a pro-democracy rally at a shopping mall in the Sha Tin neighborhood in northern Hong Kong. A local ordinance says that people convicted of desecrating the Chinese flag in Hong Kong by “publicly and willfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling on it” face a fine of nearly $6,400 and imprisonment for up to three years. Under Hong Kong law, children are defined as being under 14 years of age. Those 10 or older can be found guilty of committing crimes, but no one younger than 14 can be sentenced to prison. The Oct. 1 holiday will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China under the Communist Party. Beijing does not want anything to mar the occasion, but the protesters plan to do just that. They have called for a day of protests to pressure the local government to meet their demands for political reforms, police accountability and universal suffrage. The protesters are also venting anger with what they see as the steady erosion of the freedoms that Hong Kongers enjoy under a “one country, two systems” arrangement that has governed the former British colony since its return to Chinese control in 1997. At a National Day reception on Sunday, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, pledged that her government would do its best to stop the “continuous violence” that has gripped the city over the past few months. “As long as everyone is united and strives to become stronger, I believe that with the strong support of the central government, Hong Kong will surely welcome a better tomorrow,” Mrs. Lam said at the reception, which was hosted by the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, a pro-Beijing group. Also on Sunday, the police said that they had also arrested a 13-year-old boy on Saturday in the Tseung Kwan O neighborhood of eastern Hong Kong. The boy was arrested on suspicion of unlawful assembly and of possessing “instruments fit for unlawful purposes.” In a statement, the police said the boy had been carrying spray-paint and “laser guns,” the authorities’ term for the laser pens that many protesters have used this summer to annoy officers. Edith Leung, an officer in one of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy political parties, posted a video on Facebook that she said showed the boy being led away by police. The footage shows police leading away a boy — who wears a white T-shirt black shorts and sneakers — as bystanders shout “Corrupt cops!” Ryan Ho, 20, a university student who attended a protest in Hong Kong on Sunday, said that in his experience, Hong Kong police officers tend to ""snatch” a disproportionate number of younger people, especially secondary school students, while making arrests at protests. “It just so happens that they are more vulnerable and less resistant,” he said."
53,Romania Pushes to Be Treated as a Fully Fledged E.U. Member,"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 11:17:53 +0000",Steven Erlanger,"More than 12 years after joining the bloc, the country’s leaders say it has made progress against corruption and deserves expanded rights for travel and trade.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/europe/romania-eu-schengen-zone.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"BUCHAREST, Romania — More than 12 years after joining the European Union, Romanians are getting increasingly grumpy. Romania pulled off a successful six-month presidency of the European Union, its first time in that role, and has made considerable progress integrating into Europe. Romanian officials have important jobs in Brussels, including Mircea Geoana, who was just named deputy secretary general of NATO, the first person from the old Eastern Bloc to have the job. But many in Romania and Bulgaria, which both joined the European Union in 2007, feel that they remain under probation, as second-class citizens. They have not been allowed to join the Schengen zone of passport-free travel, and they are still under a special program to monitor corruption. Romanians acknowledge continuing problems with corruption and oligarchy — after all, the man once considered to be the most powerful politician in the country, Liviu Dragnea, the head of the largest party, the Social Democrats, is serving a prison term for abuse of power. But they argue that Romania is making considerable progress and that admission to the Schengen zone shouldn’t hinge on the corruption problems. The country has long borders, but it has invested heavily in protecting them, and Romanians tend to think that they have as much right to be part of the passport-free area as Schengen members like Hungary, which has similar problems with corruption and is seen as a bigger violator of the rule of law, not to mention Norway and Iceland, which are not even members of the European Union. Romania and Bulgaria were judged by the European Commission to have met all necessary technical conditions for full Schengen membership as far back as 2011. No other countries considered to have met the criteria have been kept out. “We see it as discrimination,” George Ciamba, the Romanian minister for European affairs, said in an interview. “We showed solidarity during the migration crisis and took people from boats in Malta, and we expect this solidarity to be returned.” But the migration crisis has complicated matters, he said, noting that, “Political correctness now means you can be tougher on fellow Europeans.” Mr. Geoana, the designated NATO deputy secretary general and a former foreign minister, calls the Schengen matter “a deeply political issue,” laced with prejudice. Excluding Romania “is not only unfair but illogical — the routes of migration are not across Romania,” he said. The country has successfully protected its borders, he added, having blocked much of the smuggling between the Russian and Italian mafias. The problem goes deeper, Mr. Geoana said: “It’s associated with the Roma and Romanians in Europe. There is prejudice here, and it harms us. With three to four million Romanians working abroad, you need a scapegoat.” Many of those workers are young, well-educated Romanians seeking a better life elsewhere in Europe. They send money home — an important contribution — but as the economy improves, officials express hope that the need for a better-trained labor force and a low unemployment rate will entice people to return. Still, Romania has been a political mess for several years. A deadly nightclub fire in 2015 that prompted huge demonstrations brought down one government, and protests reignited in the face of institutional corruption and what many saw as efforts to undermine the judiciary, including the firing of Laura Codruta Kovesi, chief prosecutor of the National Anticorruption Directorate, in July 2018. Then came the fall of Mr. Dragnea and, later, the collapse of the coalition government. Now Ms. Kovesi is expected to become the bloc’s first chief public prosecutor, over the objections of her own government. All this has had an inevitable impact in Brussels, even if European officials have noted the rise of younger, more liberal, pro-European politicians who did well in  European elections in May. That vote saw support for the Social Democrats to fall by nearly half, and the rise of an alliance of two new parties, the Save Romania Union and Plus, which was founded by a former European commissioner, Dacian Ciolos. Presidential elections in November are expected to be closely fought. Prime Minister Viorica Dancila has also complained about the special monitoring of corruption and judicial reform carried out by the European Commission on Romania and Bulgaria, known as the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. Other relatively new members of the European Union, such as Croatia, are not submitted to such oversight. “If the C.V.M. would be valid for all member states then I wouldn’t be speaking about a double standard,’’ Ms. Dancila told the British newspaper The Guardian in July. Mr. Ciamba, the minister for European affairs, echoed those sentiments. “We don’t have problems with rules so long as they apply to all,” he said. The special monitoring was supposed to be a transitional measure, but it remains in place 12 years after Romania and Bulgaria joined the bloc. However, commenting on the latest C.V.M. report, in November, Frans Timmermans, then the European commissioner for the rule of law, said, “I regret that Romania has not only stalled its reform process, but also reopened and backtracked on issues where progress was made over the past 10 years.’’ Correcting course, he added, “is the only way Romania can resume its path toward the conclusion” of the monitoring process. But some member states, shaken by the rise of far-right and populist parties and by the political pressures of migration, have no interest in allowing Romania and Bulgaria to enter the Schengen zone. At a summit meeting in Sibiu, Romania, in March — the showpiece event of Romania’s presidency of the European Union — Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands was blunt. Asked when Romania would be able to join Schengen, he said: “When you comply with the rule of law, democracy. And you are not moving in the right direction at the moment.” Cristian Ghinea, a former minister for European funds and a member of the European Parliament for the Save Romania Union, said that joining Schengen had “a symbolic value.” “It is this feeling that the E.U. accession is not complete,” he said. Schengen is also important for business and for travel, he noted, since Romanian citizens and Romanian trucks must pass through border controls, complicating their participation in Europe’s single market. Bianca Toma, an analyst at the Romanian Center for European Policies, a research organization in Bucharest, said that despite the success of Romania’s presidency of the bloc, “there is still mistrust in the new members of the club.” But Romania “is making progress toward being the country the E.U. wants it to be,” she added, noting, “From civil society, the young, those with connections abroad, there’s significant resistance, involvement and commitment to change the negative side.” “If we look at the politicians only, we can get pessimistic,” she said. “But there is only one direction for the country to go.” Ms. Toma predicted that the November presidential election would confirm Romania’s shift toward the more liberal politics that were signaled in the European elections in May. Local elections follow in summer 2020, with parliamentary elections scheduled for fall of that year. “We’ll see a significant change of the political landscape,” she said. “I’m not saying that the new ones will be much better, but we’ll get rid of a lot of the old habits.”"
54,Bus Bomb Kills 12 Iraqis Near Major Pilgrimage Site,"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 22:14:10 +0000",Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan,"The attack, claimed by the Islamic State, signals the group’s continuing threat despite its collapse in late 2017.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/middleeast/islamic-state-bus-bomb-iraq.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"BAGHDAD — The Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for the bombing of a minibus that killed 12 people near the entrance to a major Iraqi pilgrimage center. The attack was one of the most lethal since the fall of the Islamic State’s de facto capital at the end of 2017, according to the Iraqi Security Forces. It was also one of the few Islamic State attacks south of Baghdad since the group’s self-declared caliphate collapsed. It brought back memories of the period after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, when Shiite pilgrims were routinely targeted south of the capital as they traveled to shrines in the cities of Karbala and Najaf. The bomb, left on the minibus by a passenger, exploded at a checkpoint at one entrance to Karbala near midnight on Friday. It killed 12 people, wounded five and demolished the bus. The security forces said they had arrested a cell of three young men who were responsible. The three had lived in Jurf al-Sakhar, an area heavily used by the Islamic State during the period when it took over much of Iraq. When the group lost that territory, Sunnis were expelled, and most have not been allowed to return. Many have had a marginal existence since then, living in areas for displaced people. The three suspects were construction workers, officials said. The attack also stands out because most of the Islamic State’s activity has been in Sunni areas, primarily in the northern Iraqi provinces of Salahuddin, Diyala, Kirkuk and Nineveh as well as the western province of Anbar. Those attacks have most often focused on members of the Iraqi security forces, local mayors and occasionally other civil servants. However, the attack is in keeping with a gradual uptick in Islamic State activity — not just in Iraq but throughout the region. It is now a holy period for Shiites between the holidays of Ashura and Arbaeen, which celebrate the family of Islam’s founder and the fight to assert its vision of the faith. During this period, millions of pilgrims visit the shrines at Karbala and Najaf, traveling from across Iraq and also from foreign countries. During the worst years of the country’s civil war, the insurgent group then known as Al Qaeda in Iraq routinely killed scores of pilgrims. Like its successor, the Islamic State, Al Qaeda in Iraq adhered to Sunni Islam while its targets were generally Shiite Muslims. The Iraqi Security Forces have largely eliminated attacks on pilgrims, so the one on Friday was a worrisome sign of the Islamic State’s continuing threat."
55,"A Young Life Ends After 4 Steps on Video, and Afghans Can’t Stop Watching","Sat, 21 Sep 2019 19:00:12 +0000",Mujib Mashal,"The Taliban bombing in Kabul that was cited as a reason to end peace talks was caught on camera, along with a man’s desperate scramble to evade death.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/asia/afghanistan-bombing-video.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"KABUL, Afghanistan — At first, the man was just walking across the street. Then he was running for his life. He managed four steps before the blast from the car bomb caught him. Since then, the last few seconds of Akbar Fazelyar’s life, captured on video during a Taliban attack on Sept. 5, have become one of the most scrutinized moments in Afghanistan, slowed down and watched frame by frame on countless mobile phones and computer screens. Though violent deaths are appallingly common in this country, Afghans have been seized with fascination and dread by the clip’s reminder of how little separates life from death. In the United States, the Taliban attack in Kabul, the Afghan capital, was noted because President Trump cited it, along with the death of American and NATO soldiers in the blast, as the reason for calling off negotiations with the insurgents. In Kabul, it was another painful example of how any corner of the capital — wedding halls, mosques, tuition centers — could suddenly become a battlefield, and of how seemingly everyday decisions could have momentous consequences, bringing disparate lives together at their end. Alongside the 11 others who lost their lives in the attack that day, what had brought Mr. Fazelyar to his death? A kindness to one of his employees, and the time between one and two cups of tea. Mr. Fazelyar owned a small shop selling and installing computer and networking equipment. He took life slowly and simply, devout in his religious observances. Single in his mid-30s, his main hobbies were watching cricket and going for a weekly swim in an indoor pool a short walk from his store, his friends say. Mr. Fazelyar had clients across Kabul, and on the Thursday that he died he had brought an invoice for about $200 to one of them. Usually his assistant, Muhammad Atif, would deliver the invoices. But Mr. Fazelyar decided to take this one himself; the client was a friend he had not seen for awhile. After presenting the invoice to his friend and client, Ahmadshah Meraj, the two men caught up over a cup of green tea. Mr. Meraj recalled offering Mr. Fazelyar another cup of tea and a car ride to his next stop. Mr. Fazelyar, feeling pressed, apologized for refusing the second cup but accepted the ride — though just to a nearby junction where he could catch a taxi. Here, security cameras recorded the arrival of more of those whose lives were about to intertwine for a few seconds before their deaths. At the junction, inside a white S.U.V. waiting to pass through a security checkpoint leading toward the coalition military headquarters, was an American soldier, Sgt. First Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, along with a Romanian corporal, Ciprian-Stefan Polschi. [Read remembrances of Sergeant Ortiz.] The soldiers were stuck in traffic just as Mr. Fazelyar walked up to the junction after being dropped off there by his friend. A nondescript van was there, too, inching along near the S.U.V. It looked like any of the gray, private Toyota Town Ace vans that shuttle residents around Kabul in the absence of proper public transport. But this van had no passengers, just a driver who was ready to kill and die, and a payload of explosives. Suddenly the van swerved to the right through a plastic lane divider. As seen in the video, Mr. Fazelyar seemed to intuit the danger. He took one, two rushed steps, then veered to break into a run. Two steps later, the van struck the white S.U.V., engulfing everything in a ball of fire. When the smoke cleared, surveillance camera footage — from the American blimps in the sky and Afghan security cameras across the road — showed little left intact at the site of the blast. The explosion was powerful enough that passengers in vehicles many yards away were seriously injured. Cameras captured the rescue of one of them: Sulaiman Layeq, an 89-year-old poet and former cabinet minister. Mr. Layeq had survived revolution, purges, war. He fled Afghanistan after the communist government was toppled by mujahedeen fighters backed by the C.I.A. and Pakistan, returning years later to take his place as a cherished Pashto-language poet. The blast nearly brought it all to an end, leaving him deeply dazed and bleeding badly. The videos show soldiers trying to pry open the door to Mr. Layeq’s car. One emergency worker in a white coat reached in through a window to help stanch his bleeding until he was freed from the car. A soldier lifted the poet onto his back, rushing him to an ambulance. Days later in the hospital, Mr. Layeq would tell his son over and over that he was proud to have miraculously survived another act of violence by his enemies. Before his brush with death, his morning had started like any other: a breakfast of milk tea and toast in his lonely third-floor apartment. And Mr. Fazelyar, who did not survive? “It was as if God was inviting him to himself,” Mr. Atif, the assistant who survived because Mr. Fazelyar took the invoice himself, said outside the shop two days after the bombing. The store was closed, with a notice in the window showing information about Mr. Fazelyar’s funeral services and his picture. Salesmen gathered outside the shop and consoled each other. “God only invites the best to himself,” one added. Often the most difficult task after a bombing is figuring out whether someone is dead or alive, and trying to identify a loved one among bodies that are unidentifiable, looking for a hint of cloth, a ring, a watch. Immediately after the explosion, Mr. Fazelyar’s assistant and fellow salesmen began calling his phone repeatedly to see if was safe. Eventually, it was answered by an intelligence officer who had helped clear the blast site. He broke the news. Mr. Fazelyar’s friends found his body in the morgue, recognizable because in sprinting away from the attack his back had borne the brunt of the damage. At the site of the attack the next morning, traffic was running as usual. Electricians repaired scorched wiring, residents in a nearby Soviet-built apartment block swept broken glass just like they had many times before, and just like they would again after another bombing the following week. Part of the American S.U.V.’s roof dangled from the branches of a pine tree about 200 yards away. Near a ditch was the gutted pouch of a soldier’s meal — “Grilled Jalapeño Pepper Jack Flavored Beef Patty.” Mr. Fazelyar was buried in his home village in Parwan Province, north of Kabul. Funeral services were held for him in Kabul two days after, at a crowded mosque that hosted nine funerals at the same time, at least two of them victims of the war. Since then, the security camera footage of his last moments has gone viral around the country, shared compulsively among a people who feel stalked by death. “The whole of Afghanistan saw the video,” said one man, Ezatullah, who was at the mosque for one of the other funerals. “He even ran from it a few steps, but death sucked him right back in.”"
56,Suspect Arrested in 1985 Hijacking That Killed American Sailor,"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 20:32:56 +0000",The Associated Press,The hijacking of TWA Flight 847 became a multiday ordeal in which a Seabee from Maryland was killed and dozens of Americans were held hostage.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/europe/twa-847-hijacking-arrest.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"ATHENS — The Greek police say they have arrested a suspect in the 1985 hijacking of a flight from Athens that became a multiday ordeal in which an American sailor was killed and dozens of Americans were held hostage. A 65-year-old suspect was being held in the hijacking and a 1987 abduction, the police said Saturday. They did not release the name of the suspect, a Lebanese citizen, who they said was arrested on the island of Mykonos on Thursday. The hijacking involved TWA Flight 847, which was commandeered shortly after takeoff from Athens on June 14, 1985, according to a police spokesman, Lt. Col. Theodoros Chronopoulos. The flight originated in Cairo and had San Diego set as a final destination, with stops scheduled in Athens, Rome, Boston and Los Angeles. The hijackers seized the jetliner and forced its crew to make three stops in Beirut and two in Algiers. The hijackers killed a 23-year-old Navy diver, Robert Dean Stethem, and released the other 146 passengers and crew members in stages, the last after 17 days. The suspect was in custody Saturday on the Greek island of Syros but was set to be transferred to a high-security prison in Athens for extradition proceedings, a police spokeswoman said. Several Greek news media outlets identified the man as Mohammed Ali Hammadi, who was arrested in Frankfurt in 1987 and convicted in Germany for the hijacking and Mr. Stethem’s killing. Mr. Hammadi, believed to have been a member of Hezbollah, was sentenced to life in prison but was paroled in 2005 and returned to Lebanon. Germany resisted pressure to extradite him to the United States after Hezbollah abducted two German citizens in Beirut and threatened to kill them. Mr. Hammadi remains on the F.B.I.’s list of most-wanted terrorists under the name Mohammed Ali Hamadei. Hasan Izz-Al-Din and Ali Atwa are also wanted in the hijacking. Mr. Stethem was a Seabee, a member of the Naval Construction Battalions responsible for building wartime infrastructure. Both of his parents and two brothers served in the Navy as well, according to the Southern Maryland Newspapers. At Mr. Hammadi’s trial in 1988, former hostages described the ordeal, saying Mr. Stethem was viciously beaten and shot to death. An article in The New York Times quoted an Australian passenger as saying that Mr. Stethem had said that if anyone had to be killed, he hoped it would be him, because he was still single."
57,"To Influence El Salvador, China Dangled Money. The U.S. Made Threats.","Sat, 21 Sep 2019 16:00:12 +0000",Ernesto Londoño,"As part of a push into Central America, China presented itself as a deep-pocketed partner for El Salvador’s future. The Trump administration countered with words of warning.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/americas/china-el-salvador-trump-backlash.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"ISLA PERICO, El Salvador — The offer was befuddling: A little over a year ago, families living on Isla Perico, a speck of an island in a destitute corner of El Salvador, were offered $7,000 each to pack up and move to the mainland. The islanders were told their move was necessary to help achieve China’s plan for turning a downtrodden patch of Central America into a global trade hub and manufacturing powerhouse. But they steadfastly refused, doubting that they would benefit from any bonanza the Chinese could bring. “Where would we go?” said Mercedes Hernández, cradling a 1-year-old baby. “We have a life here.” Over the months that followed, the island’s roughly 35 families would become unlikely participants in a struggle between Beijing and Washington, which wants to stop the Chinese from gaining a strategic foothold in a tiny impoverished nation that sits on its doorstep. American officials in El Salvador went on the offensive to thwart China’s foray, painting Beijing as an untrustworthy partner with hidden motives. For most of the past decade, the United States watched with unease as much of Latin America was pulled into China’s orbit through a growing network of trade and loans — which Washington did little to confront. As China presented itself as a partner with a vision for El Salvador’s future, President Trump may have played into China’s hands, his critics say. The Trump administration initially countered China with little beyond threats to the Central American nation and its neighbors for not doing enough to curb migration, one of the president’s signature issues. But then the United States took another tack: trying to turn public opinion in El Salvador against the Chinese. American officials criticized China’s legacy in the developing world in several interviews, meetings with opinion makers and posts on social media. At one point, the American ambassador went as far as suggesting China could be seeking to establish a military post in the country. “China’s agreements with El Salvador have been negotiated by a small group of individuals, behind closed doors and without the involvement of the public or representatives from the key sectors affected by those agreements,” said Jean Manes, the recently departed American ambassador in El Salvador, who was given rare leeway to publicly criticize China’s plans. China, she said, “advances its own agenda with little regard for the long-term economic prospects for or environmental impact on developing countries.” The American warnings, and the resistance of Isla Perico’s families, helped thwart China’s plans — at least for the time being. Measures that would have allowed China to proceed stalled in El Salvador’s legislature. Ou Jianhong, China’s ambassador in El Salvador, declined several interview requests and the embassy did not respond to emailed questions. In an interview with Xinhua, China’s state news agency, Ms. Ou called Washington’s warnings “irresponsible and unfounded.” The offer to create a special zone in El Salvador, by a Chinese state-owned company called Asia-Pacific Xuanhao, was summarized in a document called “Shared Opportunities, Shared Future.” A copy was reviewed by The New York Times. The deal would allow China to advance its quest to establish an alternative trade route to the Panama Canal, and enhance its ability to shape commerce in the region. The special zone also would give China a valuable perch to expand its military and intelligence capabilities in Washington’s vicinity, according to American officials who have watched warily as Beijing has invested in at least 60 Latin American port projects. For El Salvador, the deal came with significant trade-offs, and left several unanswered questions. The Chinese requested a 100-year lease of a 1,076-square-mile area — 13 percent of the country’s landmass — and demanded tax exemptions for their companies that would last three decades. Details about the financing structure were not publicly disclosed, causing concern among some Salvadorans that their country risked becoming financially beholden to Beijing for generations. But by the time the United States began its campaign against the Chinese in El Salvador last summer, the Americans had a lot of catching up to do. To some Trump administration critics, it was a self-inflicted wound. While the Chinese were offering to build manufacturing plants, invest in renewable energy and make El Salvador a tourist destination, President Trump was calling migrants “animals,” and separating children from parents at the border. “That attitude opens up space for China,” said Roberto Rubio, director of the National Foundation for Development, a research group in San Salvador, the capital. “If the United States threatens to cut our aid, treats our people poorly and brings little investment, why not go with the Chinese?” While the Trump administration has suspended aid programs to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, Ms. Ou, the ambassador, noted that China had signed 13 cooperation agreements on infrastructure, investment, science, technology, education, culture and tourism. “The cooperation with China will not in any way turn into a debt trap, but a cake for the benefit of its two peoples,” she said in the Xinhua interview. In early July 2018, El Salvador’s president, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, gave the legislature a bill that would establish the legal framework for a special economic zone encompassing 26 municipalities along the southeastern coast. It soon became clear the bill had been custom-made for the plan the Chinese had been quietly promoting for months. Among other conditions, it required El Salvador to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the island off the Chinese mainland where China’s former government fled in 1949 when the Chinese Communists took power. When Mr. Sánchez Cerén announced last August, during a televised address, that his country was breaking ties with Taiwan and establishing diplomatic relations with China, he envisioned an era that would bring “great benefits to the country and provide extraordinary opportunities.” Chinese banks are now the dominant lenders in Latin America, having provided more than $140 billion between 2005 and 2018. Trade between China and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean soared from $17 billion in 2002 to nearly $306 billion in 2018. The Obama administration did little to publicly challenge China’s deepening engagement in Latin America after the Chinese in 2009 signaled their intention to expand investment and trade in a region rich in commodities and in dire need of infrastructure upgrades. Soon after President Trump’s election in November 2016, the Chinese issued an updated policy vision for the region that was notably bolder. The update conveyed China’s desire to build military alliances with Latin American nations and signaled its aspirations to become a guiding force on global challenges like climate change, sustainable development and cybersecurity. As the deal was debated by Salvadoran lawmakers over the past year, the Chinese sought to win them over, inviting lawmakers and journalists on paid trips to Beijing. They also began disbursing a $150 million assistance package. The first gestures included buying 10 trucks for the water agency of San Salvador and donating 15,000 laptops to public schools. Ana Guadalupe, a 56-year-old resident of the Santa Fe district in San Salvador, said water service had been sporadic and unreliable before the new trucks began deliveries Tuesdays and Saturdays. “There were many places where there was no water,” she said on a recent afternoon as workers from the water agency used a large hose on a truck emblazoned with the Chinese flag to deliver water. “Without water we can’t live.” Across town, Sara Cruz, a computer teacher at Francisco Morazan school, called the new Lenovo laptops her students had received transformational. “In the past, things that were Chinese were looked down on, as being of bad quality,” she said. But the sleek laptops shared by the school’s 400 students have changed her mind. “Before we had to teach them theory instead of practice,” she said. Those gestures were not enough to overcome El Salvador’s doubts about the conditions of the deal, stoked by American criticism that the port project had been negotiated secretly. Even as China funded flashy projects that generated good will, efforts to get the special economic zone bill through Congress faltered as lawmakers expressed caution in the lead-up to the presidential election in February. Lacking support, the outgoing government never brought the bill to a vote. Salvadoran lawmakers passed a measure last August forbidding the sale of islands to foreigners, acting in response to news that Chinese entrepreneurs were trying to acquire Isla Perico and a nearby island. Yang Bo, a Chinese businessman who has lived in El Salvador for several years, was questioned by prosecutors about his role as the middleman in the attempted purchase of the islands. As questions about the Chinese venture mounted, the residents of Isla Perico, who make a modest living fishing and growing watermelons, received visits from prosecutors, the governor’s office and the American Embassy. The string of powerful visitors to their cluster of shacks strengthened the residents’ resolve to stay put. Antonio Ferman, the mayor of San Alejo, a small town near Isla Perico, said a venture of the scale proposed by the Chinese may well create some desperately needed jobs in the area, which is hollowing out as people facing unemployment and gang violence seek to migrate to the United States. But Mr. Ferman said he doubted any benefit would be worth the impact of such a project on the artisanal fishing industry, which many families rely on, and on the region’s access to clean water. A San Alejo resident, Esleta de Jesus Sariles, 40, said few in the region were putting much faith in the prospect of Chinese jobs, which in the best of cases could take years to create. Like many of her neighbors who live along a winding unpaved road with a growing number of abandoned houses, she decided to head north to the United States, having raised the $7,000 smugglers requested to take her and her diabetic teenage daughter to the border. “Nearly the whole country has emptied out,” she said. “And nearly everyone has made it through.” Shortly before taking office on June 1, the new president, Nayib Bukele, signaled he had little appetite for grand Chinese ventures despite his promises to create jobs and attract investment. The Chinese, he said, “go in, do projects that are not feasible, then they leave the countries with huge loans they cannot repay and use that as leverage.” Weeks after taking power, however, he struck a different note and ruled out the possibility of switching El Salvador’s allegiance back to Taiwan. “We need to recognize China’s status in the world,” he said. And in the long run, some American officials fear that China’s willingness to build roads, railroads and ports in the region will be impossible for El Salvador and some of its neighbors to resist. Norma Torres, a Guatemalan-born representative from California who has become a leading voice on Central America policy on Capitol Hill, said the Trump administration’s focus on keeping migrants out will benefit China. “They are not looking at short-term, immediate results as we do here in the United States,” Ms. Torres said. “The Chinese have focused on, ‘Where are we going to be in the next 20 years?’” While the port deal was sidetracked, at least for the time being, it is clear the Chinese are positioning to become El Salvador’s ally of choice. “Under the careful care of each side, the China-El Salvador relationship will, without doubt, transform from a shrub into a verdant tree,” Ms. Ou, China’s ambassador, wrote in a recent opinion piece published in a local newspaper. “The bilateral cooperation will be as fragrant and delicious as Salvadoran coffee and as sweet and tasty as the sugar of this beautiful nation!”"
58,Revolutionary Guards in Iran Vow ‘Full Destruction of Any Aggressor’,"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 19:04:00 +0000",Reuters,"Iran will pursue and seek to destroy any aggressor, even one carrying out a limited attack, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Saturday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/middleeast/iran-saudi-oil-attack.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"DUBAI — Iran will pursue and seek to destroy any aggressor, even one carrying out a limited attack, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Saturday, after attacks on Saudi oil sites, which both Riyadh and American officials blamed on Tehran. “Be careful, a limited aggression will not remain limited. We will pursue any aggressor,” the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, said in remarks broadcast on state TV. “And we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.” President Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia’s air and missile defenses after the Sept. 14 attack. Iran denies involvement in the attack, which was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran that is fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s civil war. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who heads the Revolutionary Guards’ aerospace branch, said any attacks on Iran would receive “a crushing response,” the official news agency IRNA reported. A senior Iranian military official, Brig. Gen. Ghadir Nezami — head of international affairs and defense diplomacy at Iran’s General Staff of the Armed Forces — announced on Saturday that Iran, China and Russia would begin joint naval exercises in the Arabian Sea and the North Indian Ocean in the near future, according to Iran’s semiofficial Fars news agency. The United States imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday, targeting the Central Bank of Iran, which was already under American sanctions; the National Development Fund of Iran, the country’s sovereign wealth fund; and an Iranian company that American officials said is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases. Iran’s foreign minister denounced the sanctions against its central bank as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine. “This is a sign of U.S. desperation,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in remarks shown on state television. “When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under ‘maximum pressure’ has failed.” Mr. Zarif, who was in New York for the coming United Nations General Assembly, said that on Wednesday he would meet with foreign ministers of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was agreed with Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia as well as the United States. The United States withdrew from the accord last year and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Iran. After reports on social media on Friday of a cyberattack on some petrochemical and other companies in Iran, a state body in charge of cybersecurity denied there had been a “successful” attack. “There has not been a successful cyberattack on oil facilities and other critical infrastructure,” said an official statement carried by IRNA. NetBlocks, an organization that monitors internet connectivity, earlier reported “intermittent disruptions” to some internet services in Iran starting on Friday evening. The group said the impact was limited, affecting only specific providers, and the cause was unclear. “Data are consistent with a cyberattack or unplanned technical incident on affected networks as opposed to a purposeful withdrawal or shutdown incident,” it said in a tweet."
59,"She Fled Famine in North Korea, Then Died Poor in a Prosperous Land","Sat, 21 Sep 2019 11:24:14 +0000",Choe Sang-Hun,"A woman who fled famine in North Korea and her 6-year-old boy died alone and impoverished in Seoul, their bodies undiscovered for weeks. A country is asking why.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/asia/lonely-deaths-of-a-refugee-mother-and-her-son-unsettle-south-korea.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"SEOUL, South Korea — It was sad enough when the bodies of Han Sung-ok and her 6-year-old son were found in their $74-a-month apartment in Seoul in July, two months after they had died. But the story became national news after it emerged that Ms. Han, 42, was a North Korean who had fled famine in her homeland, and that the two had died alone and impoverished in one of Asia’s richest cities. Their bodies were so decomposed that the cause of death could not be determined, according to the authorities. But several South Korean news outlets have reported that they died of starvation, and officials have not disputed those reports. The news channel that broke the story last month quoted an unidentified police officer as saying that there was no other possible explanation. The deaths have been a shocking reminder of the hardships faced by many North Koreans in the South, as they try and sometimes fail to adjust to a radically new life. Since the news became public, thousands have visited a mourning station built for Ms. Han and her son, Kim Dong-jin, in central Seoul, laying white chrysanthemums in front of portraits of them. The most emotional visitors were other North Koreans and their supporters, hundreds of whom came from across the country on Saturday to attend a funeral ceremony for the mother and son. Speaker after tearful speaker apologized for not protecting them from the prejudices, indifference and ostracism that many North Koreans say they experience in the South. “I am still struggling to understand this: She escaped a famine in North Korea — only to starve to death in the heart of South Korea, where there is so much food that going on a diet is its biggest fad,” said Heo Kwang-il, who leads a North Korean defectors’ organization. Not much is known about Ms. Han’s life in either Korea. But she appears to have become increasingly isolated and despondent in her last months, though help for her and her son was just a few hundred yards away at a district government office. She first arrived in South Korea in 2009, according to government records. Like all defectors from the isolated, totalitarian North, she went through 12 weeks of mandatory classes, learning basic skills like using a credit card and driving a car. The government provides North Korean refugees with low-rent apartments, welfare payments and free health care and job training. But many struggle to make the transition from the North’s highly regimented system to the South’s fast-paced, capitalistic one. A few have even returned to the North, complaining that they had been treated like second-class citizens in the South. Ms. Han got off welfare in nine months, suggesting that she was adapting quickly to her new life. But Kim Yong-hwa, the head of the NK Refugees Human Rights Association of Korea, who knew Ms. Han, said she had been carrying an emotional burden. She had originally fled the North for China in the wake of the famine that killed millions of North Koreans in the late 1990s, according to Mr. Kim. He said she became one of the thousands of North Korean women sold by human traffickers to rural Chinese men looking for wives. Such women live with the constant fear of being returned to North Korea and sent to a labor camp. Rights groups say that many of the women’s Chinese husbands exploit that vulnerability and sexually abuse them. Some North Korean women in that situation have made their way to South Korea with children they had in China, only to face the stigma of being a single mother in the South, along with all the other difficulties of adjusting to life there. Ms. Han initially came to the South alone, leaving a young son behind with her husband, according to Mr. Kim, who said he helped arrange her escape through Thailand, using smugglers. She paid the smugglers $2,000 after arriving in the South and getting cash support from the government, Mr. Kim said. “But she terribly missed her son in China,” he said. In 2012, Ms. Han asked her husband, an ethnic Korean, to join her in South Korea with their son. The man found work at a shipyard. Another son — Dong-jin — was born in 2013. They soon discovered that he had epilepsy. South Korea’s shipbuilding industry entered a slump, and Ms. Han’s husband lost his job. In 2017, the family moved back to China. Last September, Ms. Han returned to South Korea with Dong-jin, having divorced her husband, according to Mr. Kim. He said she called him, sounding depressed. She was afraid she wouldn’t be able to work, because she couldn’t find a child-care center that would accept an epileptic child. He said he advised her to apply for welfare benefits. What happened to Ms. Han and Dong-jin after that is not clear. North Korean defectors are closely supervised by the government for five years, but that time period had expired. The district office says Ms. Han never applied for welfare. Other North Koreans in Seoul have said that she did not have close friends among them. She apparently could not afford a cellphone, meaning she would have been even more isolated. In her last months, her only income was $165 per month in government child support. In March, when Dong-jin turned 6, that amount was cut in half. A social worker visited in April and reported that no one was home. On May 13, Ms. Han withdrew the last money in her bank account: $3.20. On July 31, a meter man went to the apartment because the gas and water bills had gone unpaid for months. The smell was terrible, and he called the police. (Neighbors later told reporters that they thought it had been from a compost pile.) The police later estimated that Ms. Han and Dong-jin had died in late May. Forensic investigators found no evidence of poisoning or physical trauma, nor was there any sign of a break-in. The refrigerator was empty except for a bit of chili powder. Lee Jung-bin, an emeritus professor of forensic medicine at Gachon University near Seoul, said that starvation would be hard to prove in such a case, even if circumstantial evidence pointed to it. “If they don’t find any clear clues, like poisoning, forensic examiners will have to settle for ‘cause of death unknown,’ ” he said. Many other questions are unanswered. Why didn’t Ms. Han ask for emergency assistance at the district office? Why didn’t she report her son’s illness, which would have entitled them to disability support? Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector-turned-journalist in Seoul who has been investigating the case, said Ms. Han could have withdrawn $4,500 that she had originally deposited to secure the apartment. “She either didn’t know how to navigate the South Korean system and find the help that was available, or just felt so hopeless about her situation that she gave up trying,” Ms. Kang said. Another North Korean refugee, Lee Min-bok, said: “She died not because she didn’t have any food, but because she had no hope.” Helping defectors from the North has not been a political priority for South Korea in recent years, as the government has focused on improving ties with Pyongyang. And as the economy has slowed, there has been resistance to increasing subsidies for the refugees, who some see as competitors in a tough labor market. But the deaths of Ms. Han and her son have unsettled many people. Government officials stood in silence in their memory this month, at a meeting to discuss how to repair gaps in the welfare system for defectors. Later, they announced that the government would check in with all 31,000 North Koreans living in the South, to make sure that anyone who needed help received it."
