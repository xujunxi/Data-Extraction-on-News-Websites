Police say he was walking in the area of the area of Danforth Avenue and Pharmacy Avenue just before 9 p.m. when he crossed the street mid-block and was struck by a vehicle less than a block from his home.  He was rushed to hospital, where he died.  Emma Anwar, one of Chowdhury's eight grandchildren, said he was walking home from the mosque when it happened. Although the father of four died just over a day ago, Anwar said there's already been an overwhelming response from the community.  ""All these strangers are coming in saying 'I knew your grandfather,'"" Anwar told CBC Toronto Wednesday.  Emma Anwar, granddaughter of Salauddin Chowdhury, says she wants the city to add more crosswalks in the area.  (Angelina King/CBC) ""He was funny. He was really nice. Everyone knew him around here. He talked to everybody.""  And he was always walking, she said.  Chowdhury moved to Toronto six years ago from Bangladesh, where friends say he had worked as a city councillor for 18 years.  ""[He] never made a complaint against anybody,"" said Parbez Ahmed, a family member. Parbez Ahmed, a relative of Salauddin Chowdhury, says speed limits in the area should be reduced.  (Chris Langenzarde/CBC)  He says he was in the hospital until midnight Tuesday night with the rest of the family.  ""I miss him a lot.""  'For a senior, it's very hard' Now Anwar hopes the city will make changes to tackle pedestrian safety.  And she says the answer is simple: add more crosswalks.  ""There's one down the street, but the other one is so far down,"" she said. ""He was old, so it just takes a little bit longer.""  Posters commemorating Salauddin Chowdhury at the scene of the fatal accident.  (Angelina King/CBC) Kaniz Fatima, a family friend, says it's very sad to accept an accident like this.  ""For a senior, it's very hard,"" she said. ""Just keep him in your prayers.""  Most vulnerable pedestrians are elderly So far this year, 27 pedestrians have been killed in Toronto — and 10 of those deaths happened in Scarborough, according to Toronto Police Sgt. Brett Moore.  Of those 27 victims, more than 80 per cent were 55 years or older.  ""It's [a] fact that a vulnerable person — a senior member of our society — is way over-represented in the statistics, and so that's a demographic that we are focused on and trying to connect with more and more,"" Moore said.  SAFER STREETSAfter a woman was killed while crossing the street, what needs to change at Yonge and Erskine? SAFER STREETSWhere are Toronto's most dangerous intersections? You told us  Now, in an attempt to curb the fatalities, he's encouraging people to talk to their elderly family members or friends about road safety.  ""We're kind of reminding people, if you have seniors in your in your life ... have a conversation about walking across the street,"" Moore said.  ""Yes, it's about traffic enforcement. Yes, it's about engineering. Yes, it's about educating and talking to people. But it's also getting people to recognize some of the risky behaviours that we all have. Nobody's perfect.""  Speed, alcohol not factors in crash Moore said there could be ""kilometres in between intersections or crosswalks,"" which is why some people cross mid-block.  And according to Det. Joe Kranjak, that's exactly what happened in the crash that killed Chowdhury.  According to police, a 2012 Mercedes — driven by a 41-year-old man — heading eastbound on the Danforth at 8:46 p.m. hit the victim as he was crossing between intersections.  Police say they continue to investigate Tuesday's fatal crash.  (Michael Rich/CBC)  Kranjak said officers have talked to witnesses and viewed surveillance video, but are still canvassing for more footage.  Although police are still in early stages of the investigation, he said speed and alcohol don't appear to be factors.  No charges have been laid so far in the investigation. "

But two days later the creature still hadn't been cleaned up. ""I could smell it up here ... about four or five houses up,"" Piper said.  Finally, at some point on Wednesday — day four — the animal was picked up by Toronto Animal Services.  ""I'm glad it's gone,"" she said. Louise Piper says it's concerning that children can walk by dead animals that haven't been picked up for several days.  (Vedran Lesic/CBC) Delays up to 10 days  It turns out there's a reason for the delays — the city says it's dealing with a backlog of 260 requests for dead animal removal.  Normally, it's supposed to take between 48 and 72 hours — but in a tweet to Piper, 311 Toronto warned that because of the high volume, it could now take up to 10 days for the city to collect animal carcasses.  Unfortunately, due to the high volume of dead animal reporting, it can take up to approx. 10 days to remove the dead animal.^as&mdash;@311Toronto  In a statement, animal services said the city prioritizes the removal of certain animals, which affects wait times for the remaining requests.  ""Removal timelines may vary for a number of reasons, including the prioritization of sick and injured animals, increased demand as animals become more active in warmer weather, and availability of Animal Care and Control Officers,"" the statement reads.  'This is really kind of a health hazard'  Piper said she's uncomfortable having her child in close proximity to a rotting animal.  ""It's pretty gross when you have a small child and you're walking down here every day,"" Piper said.  She's not the only one with concerns.  Michael Januska says he and his wife both called 311 last week to ask that a dead raccoon be picked up from the middle of the sidewalk near St. Clair Avenue and Mount Pleasant Boulevard.  Resident Michael Januska says he's been waiting over a week for the city to clean up a dead raccoon near the intersection of St. Clair Avenue and Mount Pleasant Boulevard.  (Mehrdad Nazarahari/CBC) It's been there for a week and counting.  ""We are waiting and waiting and thinking, this is really kind of a health hazard. There's kids and families walking by, people walking their dogs,"" Januska told CBC Toronto Wednesday. ""It's just getting worse and worse. It's attracting flies."" 'There's a nice little evidence of it left there,' Louise Piper said of the spot on the sidewalk where the bagged raccoon had been left for several days.  (Vedran Lesic/CBC) Now he says the animal is in ""an advanced stage of decomposition.""  ""If this is a volume issue, how many other animal cadavers are around the city in public spaces, public parks, that have to be dealt with?"" he said.  ""I think the city is waiting for it to turn to dust and blow away.""  What to do if you come across roadkill   According to the city's website, you can submit a service request for the removal of a dead animal online or over the phone — although there's no telling exactly how long it will take to get picked up.  VideoIs Toronto the raccoon capital of Canada? Roadkill for dinner? Rules vary by province and territory in Canada  The city warns residents not to touch the animals with their bare hands, but to wear gloves and place the carcass in a plastic bag. While Toronto Animal Services will pick up larger animals, the city's Solid Waste Management Services will pick up smaller wildlife, like mice, rats, small birds, or chipmunks. "
2,1.5296397,"Less student supervision, less school cleaning: memo outlines CUPE's work-to-rule plan","Wed, 25 Sep 2019 08:36:32 EDT",CBC News,A union representing education workers and the Ontario government have scheduled two days of last-minute contract talks in an effort to avoid a work-to-rule campaign.,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cupe-work-to-rule-latest-1.5296397?cmp=rss,"A union representing education workers and the Ontario government have scheduled two days of last-minute contract talks in an effort to avoid a work-to-rule campaign. CUPE, which represents 55,000 education workers in Ontario, has formally submitted notice that puts it in a legal strike position as of Monday. The new meetings between the union, province and the Council of Trustees' Associations are set for Saturday and Sunday. The union also took the step Wednesday of outlining what work-to-rule will look like. No CUPE member will ever do anything to make a school unsafe or put students at risk, officials say. However, memos sent to workers contain a long list of tasks that won't get done. That includes, but is not limited to, the following actions outlined in a memo to members:  Clerical staff have been explicitly told ""do not supervise children."" Those workers will also stop updating the school's websites and social media feeds. Education assistants will not allow any class to proceed unless a teacher is present, nor will they participate in nutrition programs. Custodians will similarly not supervise students, nor will they pick up garbage outside, or clean ""Ministry unfunded areas"" including hallways, offices and gyms. Maintenance and Trade members will complete repairs only if the parts are in stock and on hand.  CUPE is just one of the unions locked in talks with Doug Ford's PC government. So far, none have been able to reach a deal, raising the concern of a widespread school strike that could happen this fall. The talks are happening as the government has ordered school boards to start increasing class sizes, moving to an average of 28 for high schools over four years, up from 22. Class sizes for Grades 4 to 8 will increase from 23 to 24. The government has said that will mean 3,475 fewer teachers in the system over four years, a cut it says will be accomplished by not filling vacancies when teachers quit or retire. Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce has repeatedly said the government is committed to reaching a deal that provides stability for workers, parents and students alike. Union says its fighting for workers and students Laura Walton, the president of CUPE's Ontario School Board Council of Unions, said her union is trying to protect its workers (ranging from education assistants to custodians to early childhood educators), and the services students receive. TimelineProtests, legal fights and stalled talks: Why Ontario schools could soon face labour disruptionsOntario education unions turn up pressure on Doug Ford's government ""This year we've seen those services decimated: school libraries closed over students' lunch breaks because there aren't enough library workers; school cleaning cut to the point that custodians are told they can only vacuum kindergarten classrooms once a week; eight or nine students with special needs now supported by a single education assistant; communications with parents affected because some schools have lost their school secretaries,"" Walton said in a news release.   ""If it takes job action to restore these services, then so be it."""

""Well, we've got a lot of people here today,"" said the veteran centre. ""But we're focused on the ice.""Maple Leafs star Auston Matthews facing disorderly conduct charge in Arizona The media throng assembled at the Leafs' practice facility had other ideas Wednesday, less than 24 hours after news broke that Matthews is facing a charge of disorderly conduct and disruptive behaviour stemming from an alleged May incident in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz. Having dozens of reporters and cameras on hand for the morning skate wouldn't raise eyebrows in the playoffs, but this was ahead of an exhibition game in late September against a skeleton Montreal Canadiens' roster. WATCH | Matthews speaks at Leafs' practice: Maple Leafs star Auston Matthews comments on the alleged May incident in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz. 4:07 Any controversy involving the Leafs is big news in Toronto — Matthews made the front page of the local daily newspapers Wednesday — and the added detail that the team's best player has been charged days before many observers expected him to be named captain has sparked even more intrigue. One of the first players off the ice Wednesday, Matthews briefly went into the locker room and emerged after a member of the Leafs' public relations staff said the 22-year-old centre wouldn't be taking any questions. ""It's not something that I think any of us really wish we were talking about today. Unfortunately, it's the situation we're in,"" said Matthews, still sporting his equipment. ""I regret any of my actions that would ever put a distraction on the team or distress any individual. ""I take a lot of pride in preparing myself for the season and representing the Toronto Maple Leafs as well as I can. Unfortunately due to the situation, I'm afraid I can't really make any other comments."" WATCH: Matthews charged with disorderly conduct: Hearing in Arizona today over incident with security guard. 2:27 Tavares, Leafs head coach Mike Babcock and defenceman Morgan Rielly all said they first learned of the allegation Tuesday. It's unclear if anyone in the organization knew about the charge before this week. ""You're always disappointed,"" Babcock said. ""As the Toronto Maple Leafs, we really pride ourselves on doing things right — on the ice, off the ice — in treating people. ""It's an unfortunate situation."" Rielly said the team will rally around Matthews. ""It's tough,"" he said. ""He's taking it very seriously. We understand that these issues are serious and it's not something that we take lightly."" Court date set for Oct. 22 A pre-trial conference was held in Arizona on Wednesday. The City of Scottsdale's website lists the next court date as Oct. 22. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly declined a request via email for comment when asked about the allegation. The player's agent and Phoenix-based lawyer also didn't respond to separate requests for comment. A police report obtained from the Scottsdale Police Department details the complaint filed by a female security guard employed by a local condo building where she said Matthews is a resident. She said she was sitting in her locked car when a group of men, including Matthews, allegedly tried to get inside on May 26. She said she confronted the group, who she believed to be intoxicated, and during that interaction Matthews withdrew from the conversation and dropped his pants and grabbed his butt cheeks. NHL centres say new faceoff rule should help scoring Tka-ching: Matthew Tkachuk strikes 3-year, $21M US deal with Flames The security guard said Matthews, then 21 years old, kept his underwear on. None of the allegations have been proven in court. Matthews was not arrested. ""Anything that goes bad, what you do is you take it and you get better as an organization,"" Babcock said. ""We've got a close family inside and we're going to look after Auston and we're going to look after our actions."" The coach added that he spoke to Matthews, who was expected to play against Montreal, on Wednesday morning to make sure the fourth-year pro was OK. ""I'm here for our players,"" Babcock added. ""I'm here to help them become better men and better people and better players."" Rielly was wrongly accused of uttering a homophobic slur on the ice during a game last season, and said the attention controversial situations garner in hockey-crazed markets can be difficult to handle. ""You just try not to read about it,"" Rielly said. ""We know Auston, what kind of person he is and how he acts on a day-to-day basis. This doesn't change things for his teammates."" Candidate for Leafs captain Matthews has been considered one of the leading candidates to be the named Leafs' captain, a role that's been vacant since Dion Phaneuf was traded to the Ottawa Senators in February 2016. Tavares and Rielly are also possibilities for the job — it's anyone's guess what the allegation means for Matthews' case to wear the 'C' — but they said his position within the team hierarchy is secure. It was hard not to notice, however, the captain-like poise both showed Wednesday morning under difficult circumstances. ""It's easy to cast judgment and want to make assumptions, but I think you just let the process carry out,"" Tavares said. ""We have belief in (Matthews) as a player and what he brings to our locker room."" ""He's been a leader since Day 1 (when) he walked in this room,"" Rielly said. ""We're going to support him."""

Stay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here. Here's what you need to know right now from the world of sports: Auston Matthews apologized for the 'distraction' We found out yesterday that the young Leafs star was charged with one count of ""disorderly conduct-disruptive behaviour"" for an incident back in May in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz. According to the police report, a woman working security at a condo building where Matthews lives in the off-season said he and a group of his friends appeared intoxicated when they tried to open the door to her locked car while she was sitting in it doing paperwork late one night. When she confronted them, she said, they told her they thought it would be funny to see how she reacted. She claimed that Matthews then walked away, pulled down his pants and ""grabbed his butt cheeks"" with his underwear still on. Matthews was not arrested, and none of the allegations have been proven in court. WATCH | Matthews speaks at Leafs' practice: Maple Leafs star Auston Matthews comments on the alleged May incident in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz. 4:07 A pre-trial conference was scheduled for today in Scottsdale, which is how this came to everyone's attention. Matthews wasn't required to attend that meeting, and he didn't. He practised with the Leafs and will play in tonight's pre-season home game against Montreal. The next court date in his case is scheduled for Oct. 22. Matthews issued a basic apology to a scrum of reporters today. ""I regret any of my actions that would ever put a distraction on the team or distress any individual,"" was the takeaway sentence. He added: ""Unfortunately, due to the situation, I'm afraid I can't really make any other comments."" Leafs star Auston Matthews regrets 'distraction' of disorderly conduct charge Don't expect the NHL to suspend Matthews — even though it could. There's a broadly worded clause in the NHL's labour deal that gives commissioner Gary Bettman the power to discipline players for off-ice conduct ""detrimental to or against the welfare of the league or the game of hockey."" But historically, he's reserved the so-called ""Rule 18-A"" for more serious cases. Slava Voynov and Austin Watson both received long suspensions for incidents of domestic violence. More recently, Evgeny Kuznetsov was suspended for three games after testing positive for cocaine at the world championships. He also appeared in a video someone posted online that showed him sitting next to a table with two lines of powder on it. Not to excuse Matthews' behaviour in this instance — it's not OK to drop your pants in public, or to try and open someone's car when they don't want you to — but it's fairly mild in comparison. Having said that, the commissioner can basically do what he wants. The biggest hit for Matthews will probably be to his reputation. The hockey world is generally very serious, so we've already seen the predictable sports-radio-grade takes about how this shows Matthews lacks the maturity to be awarded the Leafs' vacant captaincy. It's possible this takes him out of the running, but didn't John Tavares already seem like a more natural fit anyway? He's seven years older than Matthews, he's super-serious, he's one of the Leafs' best players, he's now got a full season with the team under his belt, other players are in awe of his work ethic, and he just generally carries himself like a dad. Checks all the boxes. Hearing in Arizona today over incident with security guard. 2:27 Quickly... There's a reason Matthew Tkachuk and Brayden Point signed for a lot less than Mitch Marner. Today, Calgary re-signed Tkachuk to a three-year contract worth an average of $7 million US per year. On Monday, Point received close to the same deal from Tampa Bay. Marner commanded about $10.9 million per year despite being in a similar situation as a star young restricted free agent. That's partly because Marner agreed to a six-year deal. The last two years come after he would have become eligible for unrestricted free agency. That's when players can really cash in, so it costs more to persuade them to give up those years. Tkachuk and Point aren't giving up any UFA years with their deals. Still, those guys (and especially Point) look like a bargain compared to Marner. Cammi Granato broke an NHL gender barrier. The Hockey Hall of Famer and former U.S. national team star was hired as a pro scout by the Seattle expansion franchise. She's the first woman to land that job with an NHL team, though a few others have worked on the hockey-operations side with other clubs. The Seattle team, which doesn't have a nickname yet, starts playing in the 2021-22 season. The Canadian track and field team hopes to avoid another shutout. The squad left the last world championships, in 2017, with zero medals. And no one came particularly close either: there were no fourth-place finishes and only two fifths. That was a big disappointment after the 2015 team captured eight medals — including two gold — and then hit the podium six times at the 2016 Olympics. No Canadians can be considered a lock to win a medal at this year's worlds, which start on Friday, but a bunch are in the mix. The best hopes on the track are sprinters Andre De Grasse and Aaron Brown, middle-distance runners Gabriela DeBues-Stafford and Brandon McBride, and longer-distance runners Mo Ahmed and Justyn Knight. In the field events, there's pole vaulter Alysha Newman, shot putter Brittany Crew and high jumper Mike Mason. Decathlete Damian Warner is a threat to reach the podium for the third time in the last four worlds. Read more about Canada's medal chances here, and read our primer on the biggest things to know about the meet here. CBC Sports' live streaming coverage starts Friday morning and you can add the full schedule to your calendar here. And finally... A new football record was set — more than a half century after it happened. Thomas Pinckard's punt for the University of New Brunswick on Sept. 24, 1966 was recorded as an 89-yarder. That's massive, but Pinckard always insisted the kick from his own 21-yard line rolled out the back of the other team's end zone after bouncing over the returners' heads. At the time, UNB's fields had 25-yard end zones, and remember that a Canadian field is 110 yards long. So that's a 114-yard boot. Back then, though, they didn't count the end zone when measuring punt yardage in Canadian football. But after studying blueprints of the old field and getting sworn affidavits from people involved in the game, the governing body for university sports in Canada certified Pinckard's punt as the new Canadian record. It surpasses the 108-yarder by the Argos' Zenon Andrusyshyn in a CFL game in 1977. No American punter will be able to beat it either. Their fields are 100 yards long, and any punt landing in the end zone results in a touchback that subtracts from the yardage. So the 99-yarder someone hit back in a 1950 college game can't be topped.

These announcements were more micro in scale in terms of their overall green plans, but did give the federal leaders a springboard to trash each other's macro climate strategies. However, the fuzzy details of their environmental policies also put them on the defensive. Refundable tax credit Scheer was up first, speaking in Jonquière, Que., outside the home renovation chain store Potvin & Bouchard. Although the Conservatives announced their green strategy in June, the Conservative leader took the opportunity to highlight one of his platform planks — a 20 per cent refundable tax credit he said will let people save up to $3,800 on green home renovations. Trudeau promises $40K interest-free loans to make homes energy efficient and safer from severe weatherConservatives highlight home renovation credit as part of climate plan And it gave Scheer an opening to slam Trudeau's green plan as a whole, saying that it was written on the corner of a napkin and that all it really reveals is that Trudeau is the ""master of improvisation."" Scheer scoffed at Trudeau's big announcement the previous day — to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada has already committed to reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Scheer said Trudeau not only can't meet the 2030 targets, but now says all kinds of things about what he can do in 2050 ""with zero details."" POLL TRACKERConservatives hold slim poll lead, Liberals only marginally ahead in seatsCANADA VOTESParties are promising to spend spend spend, but details scarce on how they'll pay for it Unlike the Liberal policy, Scheer boasted that his party has ""a real plan to protect our environment,"" and that is ""realistic and achieveable."" Not only is it the ""most comprehensive plan ever produced by a political party"" it also has the best chance to meet the Paris Agreement targets, he said. Asked for details on how he would reach those targets, Scheer said through investing in things like green technology, green tax credits. Asked again about the the lack of details, Scheer responded that his plan is costed, that it actually does have a lot of detail and a lot of figures — and then he bashed Trudeau again. Federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer took the opportunity to highlight one of his party platforms — a 20 per cent refundable tax credit they say will allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on green home renovations. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)  About 90 minutes later, and more than 4,500 km west, it was Trudeau's turn to make his pitch in Port Coquitlam, B.C. Trudeau promised interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to upgrade old furnaces, replace leaky windows or retrofit homes to make them more energy-efficient and resilient to floods and wildfires caused by climate change. But Trudeau also took the opportunity to bash the Conservatives in general, for their environmental record, or as Trudeau sees it, lack thereof. 'Do-nothing approach' Scheer's plan for climate change, Trudeau charged, is the same as the ""do-nothing approach"" of former prime minister Stephen Harper, that will ""do less and cost more"" Unlike the Conservative Party, he said, which refuses to admit climate change is a problem, the Liberal government  has done a lot to fight climate change, and acknowledges that more needs to be done.  Yet Trudeau, like Scheer, was forced to answer questions about how exactly the plan will exceed the 2030 targets.  PARTY PLATFORMSCompare the party platforms on these top election issuesFact CheckWhy Andrew Scheer's climate plan won't hit Canada's Paris targets Trudeau said the country is already three-quarters of the way there and that, over the next 11 years, not only will Canada meet those targets, but surpass them and be well on the way to net zero by 2050. And how will this occur?  Trudeau offered few details but stressed that the key, in general, is innovation that will develop zero emission technologies. FACT CHECKTrudeau's claim that Canada is 'on track' to meet 2030 climate target is misleading However fact checks conducted by CBC News raise questions about some of the environmental aspirations of both Scheer and Trudeau. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised Canadians access to interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to upgrade old furnaces, replace leaky windows or retrofit their homes. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) For example, as CBC's Lucas Powers revealed, Trudeau's claim that Canada is on its way to meet the 2030 climate target are undermined by reports issued by his own government. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), which regularly publishes updates on the country's progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, projected that even under a best-case scenario — one that takes into account policies already in place and those that are ""under development but have not yet been fully implemented"" — our total emissions in 2030 will only be 19 per cent below 2005 levels. And as for Scheer's promise to meet the Paris agreement targets, the CBC's Jonathan Gatehouse reported that a recent analysis, prepared by an economist and an environmental engineer for Clean Prosperity, found that Scheer's approach would end up being more costly and less effective than current government policies.  ""Our analysis of the emissions reductions potential of the plan demonstrates that it does not have a reasonable chance of achieving Canada's 2030 target under the Paris Agreement,"" the authors wrote."

As first reported in the Toronto Star, a Metrolinx document dated Feb. 22, 2019 shows the agency is in the early planning stages of relocating the UP Express platform at Union Station, something that could require building a new pedestrian bridge with an estimated cost of around $80 million. The document also outlines a plan to scrap the current fleet of UP trains and replace them with electric vehicles. Aikins says the reason behind the overhaul is due to the popularity of the airport rail link. Despite a rocky start, UP has experienced a 69 per cent growth since it opened four years ago and the agency predicts the trains will be overcapacity by 2028. Union Pearson Express ridership jumps after fare cut ""We know we're going to reach capacity and be overcapacity before the decade runs out. So we're planning ahead for that,"" Aikins told CBC Toronto by phone.  The 36-page document says the UP Express platform will be moved from its current location, which will require a new pedestrian bridge, a plan that the agency admits could significantly worsen customer experience at Union Station. As part of the plan, the UP platform — currently accessible from the station's west wing and complete with its own coffee shop — will be moved further south, placing it in the middle of numerous platforms servicing several lines that run through the station. The document says the route to the new platform will be extended with elevators, stairs and a bridge, which may cause more pedestrian congestion. Enhanced service coming to Lakeshore GO, UP Express train lines Some GO fares are going down — but UP Express commuters won't reap the benefits Metrolinx is also planning to scrap the existing 18 UP Express vehicles to install the same electrified GO trains the agency plans to use on the rest of its network. The change would create a merged service between the UP and the GO transit network, meaning GO trains could service Pearson from stations on the Lakeshore East and Stouffville lines, in an attempt to service a wider range of commuters.  ""You would have more options,"" Aikins said. ""It would be truly an integrated system in that more people from around the region would be able to access a fast airport service."" The Metrolinx document is also planning on increasing the frequency of the airport trains from eight trains per hour, instead of four. Some of the trains would stop at additional stations, potentially increasing travel time. Metrolinx does, however, raise the prospect of express services between Pearson and Union.   Aikins says the plan is in its early stages and the projects outlined in the document have not been finalized. ""We've got a lot of work on our hands and we're not quite ready to go to the board with it yet with a solid plan that will work,"" she said. ""We're working on it.""

The project highlights the lengths some Canadian communities will have to go to brace for the impact of a changing climate in the years ahead.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-flooding-climate-change-1.5290037?cmp=rss,"In May 2017, record-breaking levels in Lake Ontario left much of the Toronto islands underwater throughout the summer. The following year, a powerful storm hit the city in August, dropping more than 64 millimetres of rain in just a two-hour span. The rising water washed out roadways, backed up sewage, submerged vehicles, flooded basements, and trapped two men in a north-end elevator filled with six feet of water — leaving them only a foot of air to breathe when they were finally rescued by police.  Before many residents had finished clearing liquid muck from their homes, another round of torrential rain flooded buildings and basements all over again a week later. Is this the new normal for residents in Canada's largest city? ""We know that storms are getting stronger. They're becoming more frequent,"" said David Kusturin, chief project officer for Waterfront Toronto, the organization tasked with revitalizing the city's waterfront area. 'We know that storms are getting stronger. They're becoming more frequent,' says David Kusturin, chief project officer for Waterfront Toronto. For Kusturin, bracing for the next crisis is top of mind as he leads a $1.25-billion flood-protection project in Toronto's Port Lands area. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News)  For Kusturin, bracing for the next crisis is top of mind as he leads a $1.25-billion flood-protection project in Toronto's Port Lands district, a man-made, 100-hectare contaminated chunk of waterfront property. The massive, years-long effort will create a new river system capable of preventing catastrophic flooding in the surrounding area. And the project becomes increasingly important as the city keeps experiencing record-breaking lake levels and powerful storm systems, which city officials warn could get worse thanks to climate change. For Toronto, preventing the next potentially disastrous flood is increasingly urgent. And it's a reality facing many Canadian communities as they try to brace for the impacts of a changing climate in the years ahead.  A city on alert Three months after last year's double whammy of storms, flooding was on city officials' minds yet again as representatives from all three levels of government attended the groundbreaking for the Port Lands flood-protection project in November. The nearly 300-hectare area in Toronto's Port Lands and eastern waterfront area that's currently at risk of flooding from the powerful Don River. (Supplied by Waterfront Toronto) The project aims to prevent flooding throughout a nearly 300-hectare chunk of land surrounding the mouth of the Don River — a flood plain that's around the same size as the downtown core — while allowing for new development. Dubbed ""one of the most ambitious construction programs in Toronto's history"" by Waterfront Toronto, the effort was more than a decade in the making. ""It was being developed for the 100-year storm,"" explained Coun. Paula Fletcher, whose riding includes the Port Lands. ""But we are certainly having storms that are very big, more often."" This expanse, currently filled with heavy machinery, will one day be the site of a one-kilometre river valley in the Port Lands. The new river will connect with the Don River.  (Lauren Pelley/CBC News) Data from the city's resilience strategy, released earlier this year, notes the annual precipitation is expected to jump from around 790 millimetres to more than 850 millimetres by the year 2051. And when it comes to heavy precipitation days — where more than 20 millimetres falls in one go — the number each year could jump from just over 6½ days to close to eight in the same period. That's a particularly concerning trend for the Port Lands. The area is a huge expanse of concrete, built overtop wetlands once forming the natural mouth of the powerful, 38-kilometre-long Don River, which weaves through the city from the north. Please Explain: Where the major parties stand on climate changeAnalysisFighting climate change is not like fighting a war. It's harder During a major storm, water rushes down the river, and when it hits the Port Lands, an industrial area now mostly known for crumbling roads and dilapidated buildings, the water has nowhere to go, forcing it to surge into homes and businesses to the north and east. ""As soon as the first few drops of rain fall on the Don River watershed, it's like turning a tap on — the river starts flowing right away,"" said river science specialist Joe Desloges, a professor of geography and earth sciences at the University of Toronto. ""It's not just the fact you have an urban river that's very responsive to any weather event,"" he said. ""Now you've added the extreme event of climate change on top of that."" Preventing disaster To prevent a future disaster, hundreds of workers are spending roughly six years creating a new river valley. ""We are extending the Don River and creating new areas for the flood waters,"" Kusturin said. Decked out in a hard hat and reflective vest, he's standing on ground that didn't exist this time last year.  Tornadoes, floods make climate change key issue among voters'How dare you': At UN climate summit, Greta Thunberg slams world leaders in emotional address The rocky area on the northwestern edge of the Port Lands was created by shipping in around 240,000 cubic metres of shale bedrock from other construction sites. Along one stretch of the rebuilt shoreline, water flows from Lake Ontario through a grate — designed to keep out invasive fish species — and into a manufactured pond filled with dead trees, which will slowly decompose and create a new aquatic environment. This area of the development will provide five hectares of land and shoreline, which will one day feature park spaces and wetlands — returning the area to its natural state while creating an elevated, protected area for new homes and businesses. The project's goal is to protect a huge chunk of land from flooding by transforming the Port Lands from a concrete jungle to a river valley. On the northwestern edge, new land is being created by shipping in around 240,000 cubic metres of shale bedrock from other construction sites. Workers are also building a river to stretch across the area and collect surging storm water from the mouth of the Don River to the north.  Further east, an expanse currently filled with heavy machinery will be the site of the one-kilometre river valley.  The winding route will start at the mouth of the Don River at the north end of the Port Lands and stretch west, creating a new island ecosystem to the south. What that means is river water will gain another entry point to Lake Ontario alongside the man-made Keating Channel, which requires water to make an unnatural, hard right turn before it reaches the lake. Set to open in 2024, the river valley will allow flood waters to take a meandering course through a natural environment — and the banks will be reinforced to withstand fast-flowing waters if there's a big storm. Millions in 150 countries protest for climate actionCanadian youth pledge not to have children until politicians act on climate change Workers using massive drill rigs are building the concrete supports for the river. ""We've been under construction on this part of the project for about 12 months ... the work that's happening all around us is constructing cut-off walls to act as structure when we excavate the river,"" Kusturin said. The 38-kilometre-long Don River, seen here alongside a stretch of Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, winds from the Oak Ridges Moraine all the way south to Lake Ontario.  (Lauren Pelley/CBC News) That excavation will involve moving more than a million cubic metres of soil to build up the valley walls, elevate the land, and create wide swaths of parkland, he said. When the project is finished, those involved hope the Port Lands will be transformed from a concrete wasteland to a new community, balancing natural and urban environments, providing a new space for living and leisure — and, most crucially, keeping the water at bay. While there are years of work ahead, one climate change expert says Toronto's billion-dollar effort could inspire other cities.  Canada is warming at two to three times the rate of the rest of the world, said international climate change specialist Elliott Cappell, Toronto's former chief resilience officer, which means regions across the country need to be bracing for the impact of rising temperatures. But the specific approach depends on the area, he said. Most of the country's population lives in major cities, which could face issues like basement flooding and dangerously high summer heat in older apartment towers. In the coastal regions, rising sea levels pose a threat. In the North, the big concern is permafrost melting. Concept art shows what the Port Lands could look like in the years to come, including this eastward view from a future bridge overlooking the new river and parkland. (Supplied by Waterfront Toronto) For Toronto, Cappell said, a single waterfront project won't change the grim reality — in the decades ahead, the city is going to get ""hotter, wetter and wilder."" ""We need to make climate change part of everything we do,"" he said. ""It has to be part of how we maintain our roads, how we plan our city blocks and buildings, how we maintain parks.""

9,1.5295961,Trudeau's claim that Canada is 'on track' to meet 2030 climate target is misleading,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:39:30 EDT",Lucas Powers,"There is still time for Canada to meet its Paris Agreement commitment, but it would require ramped-up climate change policies.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-climate-change-2030-fact-check-1.5295961?cmp=rss,"As part of our federal election coverage, CBC News is assessing the truthfulness and accuracy of statements made by politicians and their parties. The Claim: ""Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels."" — Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau on his government's efforts to fight climate change The Facts: In late 2015, Canada and 194 other countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which aims to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, with the ultimate goal of limiting the rise to only 1.5 C. As part of that multinational consensus, Canada committed to reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 — a level first set by Stephen Harper's Conservative government. On the campaign trail this week, Trudeau repeatedly said his Liberals have put Canada ""on track"" to meet that target -- and are now promising to exceed it. What you need to know to vote in Canada's federal electionPOLL TRACKERConservatives hold slim poll lead, Liberals only marginally ahead in seats But reports issued by his own government undermine that claim. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) regularly publishes updates on the country's progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In January, the department projected that even under a best-case scenario — one that takes into account policies already in place and those that are ""under development but have not yet been fully implemented"" — our total emissions in 2030 will only be 19 per cent below 2005 levels. In other words, all the climate-related policies that were on the table as of January this year would get us 63 per cent of the way to the 2030 target. Climate change and energy experts are quick to point out that projections, while valuable predictive tools, are not necessarily representations of the future. The accelerating pace of technological advancement and the possibility that federal governments will adopt more aggressive climate change policies mean that Canada could end up meeting or even surpassing its 2030 target. And Liberal candidates like to point to measures in the 2019 federal budget — such as a $5,000 electric vehicle incentive — that have not been factored into the most recent projections. Similarly, the Trudeau government helped to fund up to 1000 green energy projects across Canada, many of which will not be operational before 2022 or 2023 but will contribute to emissions reductions.  Liberals promise to halve tax rate for clean tech companies as part of long-range climate action planConservatives highlight home renovation credit as part of climate plan As things stand, however, even the most optimistic outlook relies on what the government calls ""emerging and future"" reductions — in other words, policies and technologies that don't yet exist. Kathryn Harrison, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, said that until more details emerge on the policies a re-elected Liberal government might pursue, Trudeau's claim that we are on track to meet our 2030 goal is ""misleading."" ""The Liberals haven't put meat on the bones yet. They haven't told us, specifically, what are those measures and what are the reductions that will be accomplished by them,"" said Harrison, who is also a chemical engineer. Net-zero pledge Harrison said she was somewhat surprised when, on Tuesday, the Liberal campaign said that it would commit Canada to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The announcement came a day after the United Nations climate summit, where more than 65 other countries made the same pledge. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the net-zero commitment is needed to reach the aspirational goals of the Paris Agreement and prevent catastrophic environmental consequences. It is an ambitious target and it's not yet clear how any country could get there — because it has never been done before. When pressed for specifics on what a re-elected Liberal government would do, Liberal candidate and Trudeau environment minister Catherine McKenna punted. ""Do we have all the details? No,"" McKenna said at the announcement. ""We're going to figure this out, but the first thing we need to do is we need to get through this election."" CLIMATE CHANGEConfronting carbon: Here's what it would take for Canada to meet its climate targetsAnalysisLack of details in promises gives Liberals room to move but also raises questions She also listed off a host of policies the Trudeau government implemented during its mandate, including the pan-Canadian framework on climate change that includes a price on carbon — considered by many economists to be the most effective way to curb emissions. Harrison said that a commitment to net-zero emissions is laudable but it's ""a bit cynical"" for the pledge to come in the middle of an election campaign. ""Especially for a government that doesn't have a concrete plan in place to meet its 10-year target,"" she said.

CBC Toronto spoke to half a dozen other expats about why getting to vote is important to them. Most of them shared similar sentiments about being happy to have a voice again, plans to move back to Canada eventually, and concerns about far-right politics.  Despite their enthusiasm, one expert says the number of expats registered to vote actually shows how ""detached"" those living abroad are from Canada. Expat votes will have no effect on election: expert For example, University of Toronto political science professor Nelson Wiseman told CBC Toronto more than 300,000 Canadians are estimated to be living in Hong Kong, but less than 2,000 of them are registered to vote.

The group of 11 applicants is challenging the rejection and disputing the fairness of the procedures involved in the lottery that has been used to grant all of Ontario's pot shop licences. At a hearing in Toronto, the group's lawyers argued Wednesday that under the rules set out by the provincial agency overseeing the process, those who win the chance to apply must submit certain documents within five business days once they are notified of their selection. They said an email alerting their clients of the lottery's outcome and the application timeline did not go through, and as such, the deadline should have been re-calculated based on when the message was actually delivered. The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario ""just determined that the attempt-to-notify was sufficient"" to trigger the countdown, which is unfair and unreasonable, lawyer Michael Lacy told a three-judge panel. As a result, he argued, the commission was not entitled to disqualify the 11 applicants or to select a new slate of applicants to replace them. Spurned pot shop hopefuls going to court to challenge cannabis store lottery Lawyers representing the commission, however, said the eliminated applicants were to blame for the email bouncing back since they provided the address and chose that method of communication. What's more, Judie Im argued, the commission then followed up with telephone calls, posted the list of lottery winners online and eventually sent letters by courier. Many of the calls failed to reach the applicants and three never picked up the packages, she said. When they did receive a letter notifying them of their selection, the applicants should have seen that it was dated Aug. 21 and laid out a deadline of Aug. 28, she added. ""The fault lies with them and not the registrar,"" Im said, noting none of the applicants sought to clarify the deadline or obtain an extension. The dispute largely revolves over what it means to be notified, and whether delivery or receipt of the message is required, Ontario Superior Court Justice David Corbett said. Earlier this month, Corbett paused the licensing process for the latest round of cannabis stores until the case is resolved. Lawyers representing the commission had contested the stay, saying it would interfere with the integrity of the lottery system. There was also opposition from lawyers representing the applicants selected to replace those eliminated. So far, there have been two rounds of the government lottery to determine who can apply to open cannabis stores. The first involved 25 spots and the second, 42. Lottery winners have five business days to turn in their application, along with a $6,000 non-refundable fee and a $50,000 letter of credit. The legal challenge may affect the government's timeline to increase the number of legal pot shops in the province."

The 20 per cent refundable tax credit could be claimed by anyone who spends between $1,000 and $20,000 on energy-saving home renovations. That would include installing high-quality insulation, high-efficiency furnaces, replacing doors and windows, installing solar panels and upgrading ventilation, heating and cooling systems in an effort to cut energy use. The Conservatives say the measure would allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on renovations every year. ""Together, the measures in our environmental plan will allow you to save while protecting our environment,"" Scheer said Wednesday at a campaign stop in Jonquiere, Que. A report from the parliamentary budget office estimated the proposed measure would cost the federal government a total of $1.8 billion until 2021-22. The Conservatives had previously estimated the cost to be about $900 million. The Conservatives previously announced the two-year program in June as part of their overall plan for the environment, which also includes repealing the federal carbon-pricing regime. Scheer has said he would stick with the current national target of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, but his plan for the environment did not include any analysis of how its measures would achieve that goal. The current national targets would require Canada to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions to 513 million tonnes. Scheer said Wednesday the Green Homes Tax Credit would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 9 million tonnes. PARTY PLATFORMSCompare the party platforms on these top election issues AnalysisWhy Andrew Scheer's campaign platform sounds so ... familiar Scheer was asked Wednesday whether the proposed tax credit, given it would cost $1.8 billion, is the most efficient way to reduce emissions. Scheer said cutting down on emissions by helping Canadians to use less energy is only one part of the announcement. ""The other key part of that is helping make life more affordable for Canadians,"" Scheer said. ""And when Canadians can take advantage of this homes tax credit to make renovations in their home, their own lives will become more affordable as the cost of living is reduced, because their energy consumption will go down."" The Conservatives say that in 2017, buildings accounted for 85 million tonnes, or 12 per cent, of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions."

(The Centre for Active Transportation) Addressing issues like snow and rain is something that cycling advocate Yvonne Bambrick says isn't talked about enough.  ""Montreal, they still have a huge ridership in the winter,"" she told CBC News. ""Toronto's winter ridership is definitely increasing every year as we've begun to try to properly clear key cycling routes but we're not quite there yet,"" said Bambrick.  Between 1996 and 2016, the study found that Montreal had the highest cycling increase, at 176 per cent, while Toronto came in second with an increase of 147 per cent. The city with the lowest adoption rate was Winnipeg with 24 per cent.  ""So much of the investment in cycling in Toronto and in many cities has been in the downtown core,"" said Savan.    Bike Share Toronto adding 105 new stations in $7.5M expansion   When it comes to the suburbs, Savan added, ""about a third of all the trips undertaken are less than five kilometres and can be very easily undertaken by bike,"" if that mode of transportation is promoted and bike lanes are built.  Mississauga is currently working on a $450-million climate-change plan that includes expanding cycling and pedestrian infrastructure The City of Toronto also launched a revamped Vision Zero in March aimed at making the roads safer and cutting the number of pedestrian deaths. The plan includes lowering speed limits and changing road designs. Toronto also plans to build 120 kilometres of new bike lanes in the next three years.  "

In September 1992, management at the venerable hockey arena was ready for its primary tenant, the Toronto Maple Leafs, to join the ranks of virtually all other professional sports teams. ""Beer has become an accepted thing at sporting events in North America and ... most places in the world,"" said a spokesman for the venue. ""We've become the exception rather than the rule here in Toronto."" He didn't view the availability of beer during games as a problem.  ""I don't think people having one or two beers is going to create a dramatic rowdiness here."" SkyDome had beer Beer was available at SkyDome, and Maple Leaf Gardens wanted the Leafs to join the ranks of sports teams offering suds to fans. (CBLT Newshour/CBC Archives) According to the Toronto Star, the building's management had identified beer sales as a new revenue stream that would boost the bottom line by $2 million to $3 million per year. Team President Cliff Fletcher told the newspaper that fans were unlikely to swallow a hike in ticket prices, making beer an attractive alternative. ""We're the last of the dry buildings in North America,"" he later told the CBC. Until June that year, an Ontario law restricted sales of beer at sports stadiums. But the Toronto Blue Jays had been free to sell beer at games since 1982, first at Exhibition Stadium and later at SkyDome, which had opened three years earlier and enjoyed a special exception from the provincial legislature. City council had a say  Residents living near the arena object to the potential for problems if beer becomes available. 1:35 SkyDome was far from any residential area at the time, but the same did not apply to the Gardens. And that was the basis of ""community concern"" that was the topic of a Toronto city council meeting on Sept. 25, 1992. ""There must be a few places in Canada, and in Toronto, where parents can take their kids and not have liquor sold,"" said Coun. Kay Gardner. Some people living near the Gardens were leery of the impact beer sales would have on people leaving the game. ""If you add alcohol, it will only lead to greater rowdyism and noise, which will no doubt have an adverse effect on the neighbourhood,"" said Ian Stuart of the local residents' association. Beer still not near Toronto city councillor Kay Gardner said she didn't want Maple Leaf Gardens to become a ""drinking palace."" (CBLT Newshour/CBC Archives) Gardens management assured councillors it would take steps to mitigate any problems, such as cutting off sales for the third period and hiring four off-duty police officers to assist with crowd control. ""That satisfied the committee, which voted 6-1 in favour of the plan,"" said reporter John Northcott. But the full city council still had to approve the plan, as did the provincial liquor board. ""The Gardens management is optimistic they'll be able to serve beer there sometime in October,"" said Northcott. The first beer at a Toronto Maple Leafs game was poured on Jan. 30, 1993. "

Deane Daprato has spastic quadriplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, meaning he requires help with pretty much all his basic needs. For example, he needs to be fed through a tube.

Ijeoma Ross and Mark Daprato with their son Deane. (Grant Linton/ CBC News)  ""I've got the most understanding boss in the world,"" she explained.   Growing up, Deane used to have a whole team of support around him, including speech therapists, physiotherapists, special needs educators and other social supports.  But at 21, people like Deane ""age out"" of this system and after they leave high school, opportunities to further their social development dry up. ""It's like we dropped off a cliff,"" Mark told CBC News in a conversation about what they see as a gap in governmental support for adults with developmental disabilities.  Decades ago, people like Deane would often be institutionalized, but these ""hospital schools,"" as they were called, closed in the early 2000s when the shift to at-home support was implemented.  These days, families can apply for funding for their adult children through Developmental Services Ontario and the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), which can help pay for support workers and respite care.  Mark and Deane Daprato enjoy music and play drums daily.  (Grant Linton/ CBC News) But with long wait lists and the baseline funding being just $5,000 a year, the Dapratos say the current care model hasn't kept up with the need or the demand.

Adult day programs scarce, underfunded  Twice a week, Deane attends an adult day program at Steer Friends, which operates out of a church in Markham.  ""We provide a life after high school,"" said program coordinator Jacqueline Hall-Fusco.  How this Caledon mother found a home for her daughter with a disability They do that by providing their 10 to 15 students with physical, music and pet therapy to continue their social development and by getting them out in the community so they can interact with people, which ""is huge,"" Hall-Fusco said.  Her family started Steer Friends two years after her sister Stephanie graduated high school at 21 and, like Deane, was stuck in the house at risk of regressing. ""it's a broken system,"" she said, and like the Dapratos, she would like the Ontario government to have another look at the care model.  Since Steer Friends is largely funded through donations and her family's pocket, she'd like to see support in the form of provincial funding.  How this sailing program is changing the lives of people with disabilities When asked whether the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services would consider having another look at the support model, a spokesperson for Minister Todd Smith said in a statement, ""Our government is focused on delivering on our key commitments to the people of Ontario.""  ""We are constantly reviewing government programs, with a focus on improved delivery and better outcomes for all,"" Christine Wood wrote. Mark Daprato isn't giving up on the system he feels gave up on his son. He's hopeful for reform.  ""What we know is that there's a massive inefficiency. Let's get that addressed.

In a video uploaded Monday, Toby Gu, 27, chronicles flying to the region on Sept. 22. At the outset, he describes the trip as ""pretty exciting stuff"" and talks about printing off a ""fake media pass"" and ordering a reflective vest on Amazon to pose as a reporter. The video includes graphic footage of a man being beaten, and confrontations between protesters and police. In many instances, Gu can be seen smiling and repeatedly jokes about being tear gassed. Gu said in one segment he was hoping for a ""confrontation"" and for ""bad things [to] happen.""  ""I don't want people to get hurt, but at the same time, that's what makes footage,"" he said. Gu's comments come from a second version of the video. He says he deleted the original and uploaded a new one that was ""very minimally edited"" to ""change the tone.""   There's no pleasing these people.- Toby Gu The new version also includes an apology. ""I wanted to share the brutality, the pain, and the difficulties that residents here in Hong Kong are experiencing every single day when they try to go out and fight for their freedom,"" he said in the video. ""Unfortunately at the same time I was trying to get more views, I was trying to get this video to explode, I was trying to get exposure — and it looks like I got that, but in a bad way."" Online reaction to the video was swift. It has been downvoted by thousands of users. ""Hong Kong is not your playground, Hong Kong is our home. It is not a game, it is about fight for our justice. Shame on you!"" wrote YouTube user Zoe Wong. Richard Scotford, a freelance journalist who has written for the Hong Kong Free Press, bemoaned YouTubers coming to the city ""to get sensational video for clicks and likes to boost their online presence. ""These thrill seekers are openly admitting they are faking their media documents, and this puts all the brave and valiant media who have been there every night at severe risk,"" Scotford wrote in a Facebook post. Gu said in his video that he printed off a 'fake media pass' for his trip. He later told CBC News that the information on the pass was 'true and verifiable.' (Toby Gu/YouTube) In an interview with CBC News, Gu said he wasn't prepared for the violence he saw in Hong Kong. He is now getting messages accusing him of being a ""communist spy,"" he added. ""I literally got a message about four hours ago from some guy [saying] 'Hey, I have a dagger prepared for your throat,'"" he said. Critics of his video are like ""dogs chasing a ball,"" Gu said. ""Realistically, I think I should have just kept my original video up,"" he said. ""There's no pleasing these people."" Months of protests Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, now in their fourth month, have often descended into violence late in the day and at night. The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to Beijing's control 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland. Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has agreed to withdraw an extradition bill that sparked the protests in June. But the anti-government protesters are pressing other demands, including fully democratic elections in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and an independent investigation of complaints about police violence during earlier demonstrations.

(Aly Song/Reuters) Ivor Shapiro, a journalism professor at Ryerson University who specializes in media ethics, told CBC News instances like this exemplify how the very nature of who can be a reporter is in flux. ""All of these things that were once pretty clear — because it was pretty clear who was a journalist and who was not — none of them are clear anymore,"" Shapiro said. 'Brazen' drone footage of Raptors parade 'a slap in the face' to professional operators, pilot instructor says He also called credentialing ""virtually meaningless"" in 2019 — though it is problematic for anyone to lie about media credentials, he said. ""If there's any core professional value at all that is common to the idea of journalism in almost every place in the world, it is that particular commitment to telling the truth,"" he said. Drone footage Gu, for his part, told CBC News that he called his credentials a ""fake media pass"" just so he could get more views. ""The blog logo I have on that media pass, my name and what I'm doing is all real. All the information on that media pass is true and verifiable,"" he said. In the apology section of the video, Gu refers to himself as ""almost like an independent journalist"" — but he also refers to himself as a ""tourist"" in multiple occasions throughout the video. Gu also documents a fire in his video. He says he wasn't prepared for the violence he saw in Hong Kong. (Toby Gu/YouTube) This isn't his first brush with controversy. Transport Canada says it slapped a $2,750 fine on someone who flew a drone over Toronto during two separate Raptors-related celebrations this summer. Several videos of the celebrations were shot from the sky after the Raptors' win, and at least one of them was filmed by Gu, who at the time told CBC News he didn't believe he was endangering anyone. Gu said Tuesday that he has not yet been contacted by Transport Canada, but that he expects the fine is for him. adam.carter@cbc.ca"

The Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation took the rare step of publicly releasing its bargaining proposals, saying it hopes the move will make negotiations more transparent. Union president Harvey Bischof said the Tory government has not been bargaining in good faith and has used procedural delays to slow negotiations. ""This government has rigged the system from the outset,"" he said. ""They've had their thumb on the scale since before negotiations began. We're going to take a different approach. One that puts transparency at the heart of our negotiations."" Bischof said the union's proposals include a request to roll back class size increases announced earlier this year and to link annual teacher pay raises to the consumer price index. The proposals also include a request to examine e-learning before moving ahead with a plan to make students take online courses in order to graduate. CUPE considering job action Meanwhile, CUPE's Ontario School Board Council of Unions, which represents custodians, clerical workers and early childhood educators, said it was considering a job action that could see them stop working overtime or perform any extra duties. Laura Walton said the work-to-rule campaign may be needed to pressure the government and school boards into reaching a fair agreement. CUPE education workers threaten 'disruptive' work-to-rule campaign ""My grandmother always said people don't notice what you do until you stop doing it,"" said Laura Walton, president of the Ontario School Board Council of Unions. ""It's time for the government and trustees' association to realize we've been cutting and cutting and cutting, and we just can't cut any further."" Last week, the union voted 93 per cent in favour of job action, putting them in a legal strike position on Monday, Sept. 30. Contracts for Ontario's public school teachers and education workers expired Aug. 31, and the major unions are in various stages of bargaining. The talks are happening as the government has ordered school boards to start increasing class sizes, moving to an average for high school from 22 to 28 over four years. Class sizes for grades 4 to 8 will increase by one student per classroom, from 23 to 24. The government has said that will mean 3,475 fewer teachers in the system over four years, which will be accomplished by not filling vacancies when teachers quit or retire. 'I want to reach a deal': education minister Education Minister Stephen Lecce said his negotiation team will continue to meet with OSSTF and urged CUPE to return to the bargaining table. ""I have stated consistently for months now, I want to reach a deal that provides predictability and certainty to students, parents and educators,"" he said. TimelineProtests, legal fights and stalled talks: Why Ontario schools could soon face labour disruptions NDP education critic Marit Stiles said the government could still avoid a labour disruption in the province's schools. ""If [Premier] Doug Ford was not continuing to move forward with his very deep cuts to education, cuts to classrooms, cuts that are affecting our students and our families, then we would not be here today,"" she said. Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said he supports the province's education workers as they push back against cuts made to the school system. ""Although the premier campaigned as if he would simply trim the fat, his cuts are digging into the bone, which is a direct threat to the quality of education in Ontario,"" Schreiner said in a statement."

Trudeau was forced to apologize repeatedly last week after Time magazine published a photo of him in brownface — wearing an Aladdin costume with his face, hands and arms darkened — at an Arabian Nights-themed gala when he was a teacher at a private school in B.C. in 2001. Trudeau admitted at the time to wearing blackface on an earlier occasion at a talent show in high school, an event captured in a yearbook photo. The next day, a video published by Global News showed him in blackface again at a summer rafting camp in the 1990s. 52% of B.C. voters say Justin Trudeau's blackface history is a 'serious' issue: pollAnalysisChampion of diversity or high-profile hypocrite? Who is Justin Trudeau, anyway? The Liberals said on Friday that Trudeau wanted to reach out to Singh, the first visible minority federal leader in Canada, to apologize personally for his behaviour. Reporters riding at the front of the NDP bus Tuesday did not hear the exchange and were told about it after the fact. The party did not share any details but said the call lasted 15 to 20 minutes. In a statement, the Liberal Party said it was a ""private conversation."" Singh, who spoke last week about the pain that racialized Canadians would feel when seeing the photos of the prime minister in blackface, said he would be willing to take the call, but only if it were private and were not used for political purposes. What we know about Justin Trudeau's blackface photos — and what happens nextSingh says he'll talk with Trudeau only if it's in private and politics-free At a town hall later Tuesday evening, Singh was asked about the call with Trudeau. ""Mr. Trudeau did call me. We did have a chat. I said that I wanted to keep the conversation private because I didn't want to be used as a tool in his exoneration,"" Singh said. ""But I also want to make it clear, it doesn't matter if he tells me anything. I'm not a proxy for the people of Canada.""  ""The people of Canada were hurt, they need to know that he understands. The people in Canada feel like he doesn't see the struggles they go through, that he ignores those struggles, and his policy decisions ignore those struggles,"" Singh said.  ""They need to know he cares."""

Dick collected $989.50 and handed it to Sgt. Roy Hare inside of a sealed blue baggie on Tuesday. All of it came in just one day, mostly from complete strangers who stopped at his stand in Belle River, Ont. last month. ""I had this one lady drive all the way from who knows where to give me a $50 bill,"" said Dick. As the recipient, Hare will be able to fly to Ekeren, Belgium next month. It's a place he hasn't been since 1945, when the war ended. And he isn't sure the type of emotional reaction he'll have when he finally arrives. ""It's going to mean a great deal because it's places you've been before but of course I'll never recognize them now compared to when I was over there, because it was all in shambles,"" said Hare. ""The buildings were all bombed."" Aiden Dick said he was surprised when tallying up the donations he received, which totalled nearly $1,000. (Jason Viau/CBC) A local group, alongside Hare, will tour several war cemeteries and battle sites. Following that, there will be a parade and dedication ceremony with Belgian Army representatives and other dignitaries.

He's also a part of the Essex & Kent Scottish Regiment — that's how Dick and Hare are indirectly connected, through the 10-year-old's father, Greg.

The researchers will examine how the roughly 600,000 students who attend post-secondary schools in the region use transportation. The colleges and universities that have partnered with Metrolinx and the City of Toronto stretch as far west as McMaster University in Hamilton and as far east as Ontario Tech University in Oshawa. The research expands and builds on a previous study from the four universities in Toronto in 2015. Ryerson University says this is the largest study of its kind to date. Transport affects academic performance  Lead researcher Raktim Mitra says the program will provide important insights for urban planning. ""With such a large footprint, our universities and colleges are an important stakeholder in city-building, because our students create a significant demand for transportation, including transit,"" he said. ""And we understand that their transportation experiences and challenges have some impact on their academic performance, their well-being and whatnot."" 'Inconsistent' transit service makes for stressful introduction to university life, first-year student saysAudioChallenges for York University students who commute to campus Mitra, an associate professor at Ryerson's School of Urban and Regional Planning, said the study will help the universities understand what that impact is, and how to ensure students are on a level playing field. The study will also allow urban planners to factor students into their decisions, Mitra said. ""Through the data and our partnership with Metrolinx and the City of Toronto, we'll be able to identify key areas for improvement in transportation infrastructure that will improve this transportation experience for our students,"" he said. Study set to begin Oct. 1 The study is multi-phased, Mitra said, but the first and ""most significant"" is a massive survey of students that will take place between Oct. 1 and Nov. 15. He said he and his fellow researchers are hoping the study will provoke a discussion about the role that schools play in transportation planning. A self-driving shuttle is coming to Toronto's east endOn the Move: Commute from Hell  ""It's more than just a research project,"" he said. ""Instead, we are looking at it as a partnership between academic institutions, researchers like us, professionals, as well as the students. Through these partnerships, together we're trying to identify key problems and trying to promote a debate around this important issue."" This report from The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 24, 2019."

Laura Walton, the president of CUPE's Ontario School Board Council of Unions, told CBC Radio's Metro Morning that the move would disrupt things like cleaning operations at some schools.  ""I think it's fairly disruptive,"" Walton said Tuesday. CUPE is set to provide formal notice of the job action on Wednesday. Among the thousands CUPE represents are custodians, administrative assistants and early childhood educators. Last week, those workers voted 93 per cent in favour of a potential strike as negotiations on a new contract continue with the Ontario government. CUPE is just one of the unions locked in talks with Doug Ford's PC government. So far, none have been able to reach a deal, raising the concern of a widespread school strike that could happen this fall. TimelineProtests, legal fights and stalled talks: Why Ontario schools could soon face labour disruptions Education Minister Stephen Lecce issued a statement Tuesday re-iterating his position that the government is committed to reaching a deal. ""We look forward to continuing our work with all our labour partners to provide the predictability and stability that parents expect, and students deserve,"" he said in an email However, Walton said there's a ""big disconnect"" between Lecce's words and what CUPE is seeing at the bargaining table. She said the concessions being asked of the union would be detrimental to the public education system. ""This is something worth fighting for,"" she said. Walton also rejected the idea that education workers should prepare themselves for less as the Ontario government tries to reduce its deficit. ""People who make an average of $38,000 a year didn't cause the deficit,"" Walton said, referencing the average annual wage CUPE workers make.

This restaurateur has a tasty idea,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 04:00:00 EDT",Natalie Nanowski,"As the city launches the second phase of consultations Tuesday on reducing single-use and takeaway items, at least one restaurateur has thought of a way to keep takeaway containers out of the trash.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/plastic-recycling-delivery-garbage-environment-sustainability-1.5294823?cmp=rss,"With the rise of apps like UberEats, Foodora and DoorDash, food delivery sales in the country rose between 49 and 54 per cent in 2018, according to Restaurants Canada, making skipping the dishes easier, but also putting more single-use items like takeout boxes, plastic cups and utensils in the trash.  Should consumers be paying more for the dine-and-toss convenience? Or should the industry be responsible for coming up with environmentally friendly packaging? Some Toronto businesses think the answer is both.  At Farm'r restaurant on The Esplanade, before customers pick their protein and sides, they have to decide whether they're eating lunch on a plate or taking their food to go in one of the restaurant's reusable containers.   Customers buy the containers for $4 and then return them for a full refund the next time they're in.  Take out industry is booming The concept is owner Kyle Webster's way of taking sustainable food to the next level.  ""Takeout is the fastest growing segment in the restaurant business,"" said Webster. ""We found that a lot of biodegradable containers weren't getting disposed of properly and ended up in landfill … Same with the recyclable ones.""  Jo-Anne St.Godard, executive director of the Recycling Council of Ontario, says that's true.  At Farm'r, the plastic takeout containers are washed and sanitized before every use.  (Tina Mackenzie/CBC News ) ""Unfortunately we're only recycling just over 10 percent of all the plastics we're actually creating,"" said St.Godard.  The City of Toronto collects more than 490,000 tonnes of waste annually from residents and other customers. And that doesn't include the many businesses, office towers and highrise condos that have to hire private trash disposal services.  About 18 per cent of what the city collects is blue bin material. Exactly how much of that is single-use items is unclear, those aren't tracked. But given the growing takeout industry the city says the numbers are significant.  Toronto wants to reduce single-use items Toronto is launching the second phase of public consultations Tuesday on reducing single-use and takeaway items. The hope is to reduce people's dependence on convenience items like paper cups or plastic containers.  The City of Toronto says charging people or businesses extra for opting for single-use containers is an option that's going to be discussed during the consultation process. Residents have until Nov. 4 to submit their thoughts on single-use items. People will need viable alternatives and St. Godard says having industry bear the full cost isn't realistic; customers should be required to dish out for more sustainable options as well. ""Consumers can vote with their chequebooks … You want to support businesses that are innovating,"" said St. Godard.  Ottawa announces plans to ban single-use plastics starting in 2021 at the earliest ""Businesses should always be looking at alternatives and experimenting to make the industry more sustainable."" For Webster, his reusable to-go container has been a small success. Farm'r started offering the option in August and quickly ordered more after selling out in the first week. Every time a customer returns one, they're washed and sanitized on site.   ""We have about 50 now in circulation,"" said Webster. ""We give the customer 50 cents off their meal when they use our container or even if they use their own."" One of the Green to Go drop off bins around Durham, North Carolina. Users scan the barcode before dropping off the reusable container.  (Green to Go ) The hope is to expand the service by getting other restaurants on board.   ""This way, we can make it even more accessible for people by dropping the price point ... making the environmentally friendly choice become easier,"" said Webster.  A revolving takeout container service already exists in Durham, North Carolina. It's called Green to Go.  6 ways to do takeout — without the wasteThis is what happens to the e-waste you drop off for recycling The green plastic boxes are found in grocery stores and restaurants. Crystal Dreisbach got the idea about 10 years ago. She says the yearly subscription costs $25. People use an app to sign out the containers and then drop them off at one of several locations.  ""We pick them up and sanitize them and redistribute them by bicycle,"" said Dreisbach. ""Currently we have 27 providers and 775 subscribers."" "
29,1.5295027,Liberals promise to halve tax rate for clean tech companies as part of long-range climate action plan,"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 08:58:37 EDT",Kathleen Harris,"A re-elected Liberal government would halve the corporate tax rate for companies that develop or manufacture products with zero emissions, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau announced today as part of the party's plan to move to net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-climate-change-action-plan-2050-1.5295027?cmp=rss,"A re-elected Liberal government would halve the corporate tax rate for companies that develop or manufacture products with zero emissions — part of the party's plan to move to net-zero emissions by 2050, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau announced today. Taxes for small clean technology businesses would be reduced to 4.5 per cent from the current nine per cent under the Liberal plan, while larger companies would pay 7.5 per cent in taxes instead of the current 15 per cent. Eligible sectors could include manufacturing related to renewable energy, production of renewable fuels, zero emission vehicles and batteries for them, carbon capture and removal technology and electric vehicle charging systems. It's part of the Liberal promise to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050, joining the European Union and countries making the same climate pledge at the United Nations in New York City this week. ""It's an ambitious target, but it's doable,"" said Trudeau at a campaign event in Burnaby, B.C., the home riding of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. The Liberal Party's plan is to set legally-binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions in 30 years. The party says the net-zero plan would be based on the advice of scientists, economists and other experts, as well as consultations with Canadians. To date, there have been few details on how those targets will be met, but Trudeau said other announcements will roll out through the week. Net-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but those emissions would be offset by other actions such as planting trees. The Liberal plan also promises to exceed Canada's 2030 emissions goal. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says Canada reached the three-quarter mark of the 2030 emissions targets in the four years his government was in power. While answering reporters' questions in B.C. on Tuesday, Trudeau insisted that within 11 years, the country will meet and surpass the 2030 targets. 1:02 Trudeau is also announcing a Liberal government would ensure all federal buildings run on clean electricity by 2022, and that the government would strengthen green procurement policies and leverage bulk purchasing power to drive clean technology. According to the Liberal Party, the clean tech tax measure would cost about $15 million in 2020-21 and rise to about $67 million by 2023-24. The other measures Trudeau announced would be paid for by current departmental resources, the party said. NDP's Jagmeet Singh pledges $15B for green jobs, fight against 'crisis of epic proportion''How dare you': At UN climate summit, Greta Thunberg slams world leaders in emotional address The Liberal Party said costing details would be released over the course of the campaign. The party has not released a costing analysis carried out by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as the Conservatives and NDP have been doing with their announcements. Trudeau said climate change is the great global challenge of the age and tried to frame the choice Canadian voters have to make in the upcoming election as one between ambition and complacency. ""Do you want to be represented by a team that has a serious, ambitious plan that is committed to do more, or do you want a team of climate deniers with no long-term vision for Canada's environmental and economic future?"" he said. Earlier today, Ottawa Centre Liberal candidate Catherine McKenna, who has been serving as federal environment minister, said Canadians have a stark choice to make on climate policy in this election. Power & PoliticsAny province could veto a major pipeline under an NDP government, says SinghUN chief, Trump offer wildly different visions of confronting global challenges ""Conservative politicians want to stop this progress. They want to follow (Ontario Premier) Doug Ford's example, where it's free to pollute, where we cancel programs that are helping businesses, schools, hospitals, people save money and do right by the environment,"" she said during a campaign event at a local Ottawa company that transitions homes and businesses to solar power. ""That is exactly what [Conservative Leader] Andrew Scheer would do, too."" 'Moral responsibility' to act Pressed by reporters on how the Liberals would achieve the ambitious targets, McKenna was light on specifics. She would not say if pursuing a net-zero target would require an increase in the carbon tax, or what penalties could be imposed for not meeting legislated emissions targets. McKenna said the path forward would be charted by an expert panel, adding climate change represents both a moral responsibility and an economic opportunity for Canada. Liberal candidate Catherine McKenna, who served as Justin Trudeau's environment minister, says her party would help energy workers transition to a net-zero emissions economy by the year 2050, if re-elected. 1:35 ""We may not know exactly how to get there, but that's the same of all the countries that have committed to this and the businesses,"" she said. ""But we will figure this out, and the way we will do this is by having a serious climate plan with credible and pragmatic action, by listening to the experts and, most of all, listening to young people in the streets who are saying, 'Are you going to act for our future?'"" Millions of young people have taken to the streets in about 150 countries around the world demanding that world leaders adopt urgent measures to avert an environmental catastrophe. The worldwide action was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who castigated national leaders at the United Nations on Monday for their failure to combat climate change.  The climate change plan would include bringing in something called a ""Just Transition Act"" to give workers in affected sectors access to training, support and new opportunities to adapt to the transforming economy. In August, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May offered a similar proposal to transition oil and gas sector workers to green energy jobs. Carbon tax battle Key to the Liberal climate change action plan is the carbon tax, which set a minimum carbon price of $20 per tonne this year, increasing $10 a year to $50 by 2022. The federal government imposed the tax on businesses and individuals in provinces with no federally approved carbon pricing plan. In those provinces, the government is handing back carbon tax rebates to most residents. Several provinces have challenged the tax in court challenges without success. The Conservatives are campaigning against the carbon tax, calling it a ""Liberal tax grab"" that hikes costs for consumers. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says the Liberals policy announcements lack details and to distract from recent scandals. Scheer spoke to reporters in Thorold, Ont, Tuesday. 0:22 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said his first act in government would be to scrap the tax. Asked to respond to the Liberal announcement today, Scheer said Trudeau is a ""master at improv"" and accused the Liberals of making up policy on the fly without providing details on how it would work. He said that, under the Liberals, Canada would fall behind in the climate change fight because of the carbon tax that he says is driving up the cost of living for Canadians. ""We are committed to the targets that we signed on to. That is our plan and our plan gives the best chance to Canada of succeeding,"" he said during a campaign stop in Thorold, Ont. The NDP has said it would keep carbon pricing in place, double funding for disaster mitigation caused by climate change and create 300,000 new green jobs in infrastructure, transit, housing and renewable energy as part of its environmental plan. The Liberals are promising to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is critical of the new plan saying, ""no one believes that Mr.Trudeau is actually going to follow through on those commitments."" Singh spoke to reporters in Winnipeg Tuesday. 0:40 NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Trudeau of offering ""nice words"" and ""pretty promises"" that are not backed up by action. ""No one believes that Mr. Trudeau is going to actually follow through on those commitments,"" he said during a campaign stop in Winnipeg. ""We believe that we have to take action and now we are committed to moving away from fossil fuels. We know the future for our country and for the world is a future where we are not burning carbon for fuel."" "
